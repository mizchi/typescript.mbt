# typescript.mbt

A bridge-generation toolchain between TypeScript and MoonBit, written in MoonBit.

## Current Goals

This project focuses on three goals:

1. Parse a usable subset of TypeScript declaration files in MoonBit.
2. Make TypeScript -> MoonBit bridge types safe and ergonomic, primarily for `vite-plugin-moonbit`.
3. Improve the TypeScript declarations emitted for MoonBit-generated code.

The wasm interpreter / codegen / AOT path that originally lived in this repo
has been removed. Bridge generation and `.d.ts` normalization are the only
product surfaces now.

## Purpose Notes

- `src/parser` is the foundation for parsing TypeScript / JavaScript and
  resolving module structure (npm `exports`, `typesVersions`, `node:*`,
  `@types/*`, etc.).
- `src/checker` is the TypeScript type-system layer: structural classification
  (`classify_optional_like_union`, `classify_transparent_intersection`),
  assignability (`is_assignable_to` and resolver / generic / bivariant /
  diagnostic variants), three-valued `extends_decision`, infer pattern matching,
  distributive conditional reduction, generic substitution, alias-name
  predicates, `simplify_type` / `simplify_union`, the standard TS utility-type
  table (`Exclude` / `Extract` / `NonNullable` / `Awaited` / `ReturnType` /
  `Parameters`), and module-level validation
  (`unresolved_type_references`, `check_module`).
  Its correctness gate is a differential against **TypeScript 7**:
  `just verify-checker-soundness` runs every single-file conformance case
  through `tscheck` and compares against vendored tsgo baseline manifests,
  with the budget that matters set to zero — a file TS7 ACCEPTS that we flag
  is a soundness bug, and there are none (TP 2518 / MISS 216 / FP 0 /
  PFLEGAL 0 / TN 1750). That gate compares against vendored TS7 name
  lists, so it says nothing about WHAT a rejected file's error was, and
  nothing at all about a hand-written legal neighbour. A real compiler
  answers both: `node_modules/typescript` is 6.0.3, and
  `scripts/tsc_probe.mjs` runs it over a file the way the harness would
  (reading the `// @option:` header). Batch CL diagnosed three wrong
  rules with it and left one alone because of it — `symbolProperty37` is
  in the TS7 error set and 6.0.3 accepts it, so
  `member_name_duplicates`'s claim that duplicate well-known-symbol
  interface members merge legally still holds and the code was not
  touched. 6.0.3 is not tsgo, so a disagreement is information rather
  than a verdict. The asymmetry is deliberate: we model a subset of
  TS, so a MISS is expected and an FP never is.
  That gate says how many we miss and nothing about WHICH, so "MISS 388"
  could rank no work at all — a baseline NAME list says that TS7 errored,
  not what it said. `just checker-miss-buckets` reads the codes out of the
  submodule baselines and buckets the misses by them, cross-checking its
  totals against the gate because a miner that disagrees with the gate is a
  broken miner. Its first run retired a strategy document:
  `docs/checker-priority.md` concluded that incremental sound recall wins
  were exhausted and that only large type-machinery features remained, and
  that was measured against the **TS6** oracle — under TS7, **128 of the
  388 missing files are flippable by a pure-grammar (TS1xxx) rule** and 91
  of them need no type judgement anywhere. Twenty-four batches have taken
  **+181 TP at FP 0** so far, and most of their items were BUGS rather than
  missing features — one of them a rule the repo had already written and
  applied to every declaration kind except namespaces. The first:
  `eval`/`arguments` as an assignment target was checked at two of the four
  spellings JavaScript has for writing a binding (`=`, `+=`, `++x`, `x++`),
  so `"use strict"; eval++` parsed clean — tenth instance in this repo of
  one rule written in several places and applied in some. Two harness
  defects came with it, both of the kind this file keeps recording: the
  oracle silently preferred a stale RELEASE binary while
  `verify-checker-soundness` builds DEBUG, so six target files "did not
  change" because the run was measuring code from before the change (it
  picks the newer build now, and prints which); and `moon check
  --deny-warn` cannot gate anything here, since the tree carries 450+
  pre-existing warnings — plain `moon check` reporting `0 errors` is the
  check.
  Two lessons repeat across the batches and are worth stating once. First,
  a rule's LEGAL neighbour is the thing to test: "fires on the corpus file"
  and "stays silent on the legal spelling" are separate claims, and only
  the second keeps the gate at zero — `f(a = 1, b)` (legal) next to
  `f(a?, b)` (TS1016), `set F(v,)` (legal) next to `set F(a = 1)`
  (TS1052), a type ALIAS to `Promise<void>` (legal) next to a `Promise`
  SUBCLASS (TS1064), `type K = string` as an index key (legal) next to
  `RegExp` (TS1268). Where a legal and an illegal form are the SAME node at
  parse time, the check abstains and takes the MISS. Second, an error CODE
  is not a difficulty class: the ~15-file decorator cluster looks like
  cheap TS1xxx grammar and is mostly decorator-signature ASSIGNABILITY
  (TS1240/1241/1270/1329), so the bucket ranking had to be read by opening
  the files — the same "a label stood in for the objective" mistake this
  file records for `computed_props`, `loops`, `typeofs` and `sequences`.
  Batch BY made the ranking itself the object of study, and every step
  contradicted the step before it. The bucket table counts (file, code)
  pairs where the thing that flips is a FILE, so a file with five codes
  inflates all five; `solo` (this code is the only lever) is the honest
  yield, and the best twelve rules cover 33% of the misses. The four
  biggest buckets — TS2322 / TS2345 / TS2339 / TS2304, also the four
  errors real TypeScript users see most — turn out not to need machinery
  at all: `const x: string = 1`, `f(1)` against `f(a: string)`, `o.b` on
  `{a: 1}` and a bare `nonexistent;` are ALL already flagged, so the
  strategy doc is wrong a second way and something specific defeats an
  existing check in those files. And a CODE-keyed cover cannot see a
  FEATURE cluster: `symbolProperty*` spans seven codes and is one
  feature. Grouping by conformance directory shows `parser/ecmascript5`
  at 49 files, the largest and cheapest cluster — and the wrong one to
  take, because its files are `parserErrorRecovery_ParameterList6`-style
  broken syntax nobody writes. Corpus count is not real-world frequency;
  treating it as one is the same substitution. What that batch's rules
  actually cost is recorded in TODO.md, including four REJECTED with
  evidence — among them `override` on a computed name, which is FP 0 on
  the corpus and unsound on legal code, because a `const` string key is
  late-bindable and `class D extends B { override [prop]() {} }` is
  legal when `B` declares it. "FP 0 on the corpus" is not soundness.
  Two of the batch's findings were predicted by this file in writing.
  `TypeArgs` hid `super<T>(0)` from a walker that saw `super(0)` — the
  third wrapper-node fail-open soundness bug, exactly the third the
  `PureCall` entry below says to expect. And the family count is at
  fifteen: TS2335 existed with its helper, message and FP argument and
  read only `constructor_body` of the eight places a class body holds
  code (13th); the modifier-order rule exists for class members and
  `skip_param_modifiers` silently discards `override` (14th); and five
  parser diagnostic channels were dead inside every namespace because
  `if outer_modules.length() == 0` is correct for exactly ONE of the
  seven things it wrapped — a compiler-option file header — and was
  inherited by the rest (15th, and a variation: not one rule written
  twice, but one item's condition applied to six that do not share it).
  TS2466 turned out to be keeping a SECOND hand-written `super` walker
  that was a strict subset of the first, missing ten node kinds
  including `Call(_, args)`, so `[f(super.m())]` walked past it; it was
  deleted and delegated rather than patched arm by arm, since patching
  arms is what produces a pair. The expected yield of the namespace fix
  was large and the measured yield is ONE file, because most earlier
  rules route through `grammar_misuses`, which a workaround already
  re-drained — the value there is the bug class, not the count.
  Batch BZ then took `check_class_implements`, which checks the TYPE of
  an interface member the class declares and never checked that the
  class declares it at all — `interface I { a: number }
  class C implements I { }` was silent. That is NOT the
  applied-in-some-places family, and the correction matters: the doc
  comment stated the abstention and its blocker in writing ("it may be
  inherited from a base class we don't fully thread here"), so the work
  was removing the blocker, and the walk to remove it already existed
  inside `check_override_modifiers` and was extracted rather than
  copied. The batch is worth exactly **+1** corpus file against an
  estimate of 5, and the gap is the same lesson as the decorator
  cluster with the axis swapped: an error CODE is not a yield class
  either. Four of the five TS2420 MISSes raise that code for unrelated
  reasons — private incompatibility through interface merging, overload
  assignability, a numeric indexer — and only opening the files showed
  it. The reason to ship it is what the corpus cannot show: forgetting
  to implement a member you just added to an interface is what a person
  does, and a conformance suite written to exercise the type system
  contains almost none of it. Its whole cost was the legal-neighbour
  surface, and SCANNING the accepted corpus beat imagining cases —
  exactly 9 TS7-accepted files carry `class … implements`, and two of
  their shapes (a well-known-symbol key, a namespace-scoped parameter
  property) were missing from the case list written from first
  principles. A third route came from re-reading rather than probing:
  class/interface declaration merging, where `interface C { a: number }`
  beside `class C implements I {}` supplies the member — the shape every
  `.d.ts` uses, so missing it would have false-flagged the bridge's own
  primary input.
  Batch CA is the sixteenth instance and buys **zero** corpus files on
  purpose. `let x; let x`, `const x = 1; const x = 2`,
  `let x = 1; var x = 2` and `class C {} class C {}` were ALL silent while
  `let x = 1; function x() {}` was flagged — from the same loop, over the
  same statement list, in `check_function_var_duplicates`, which compared
  each top-level binding's name against `module_.funcs` and never against
  the other bindings. Its own comment is where the omission shows: it
  justifies excluding `var`+`var` (a merge) and function overloads (which
  legally repeat a name) and then excludes `let`+`let`, which is neither.
  No scope walk was added — only the flat `Ident` forms of
  `top_level_stmts` are read, so a nested block, a destructuring pattern
  and a `for` head all fall through, each losing a finding rather than
  inventing one. The four files in the bucket are outside that stated
  scope (a duplicate inside one destructuring pattern, an array pattern in
  a `for` head, class auto-accessors, local TYPE declarations), which is
  why the count is 0; the reason to ship is that `mtsc` type-checking
  accepted `let x; let x`, a program tsc rejects. The standard applied is
  the repo's own: the rejections recorded above were changes measurement
  showed did NOT achieve their purpose, and this one does — 7 firing
  spellings against 11 silent legal neighbours. TS2393 and TS2394 are
  blocked on one mechanical fact and say so: `TsFunc.body` is not
  optional, so an overload SIGNATURE and an implementation cannot be told
  apart, which is also why `check_overload_void_return` has to guess that
  the last declaration is the implementation.
  Batches CF and CG are ten more grammar rules for **+19 files**, and they
  are where the BY ranking INVERTS — under "MISS <= 250" the corpus COUNT
  is the objective, so `parser/ecmascript5`, which BY correctly rejected
  as broken syntax nobody writes, becomes the largest and cheapest
  cluster. The family count reached 22 (`parse_binding_ident` reserved
  `let` and `yield` in strict mode and not the other seven, so
  `class C { constructor(static) {} }` parsed clean in an automatically
  strict body) and 23 (`await using` has THREE declaration sites — a
  statement, a block-statement, a for-head — and the pre-existing TS2854
  marker was at one, so `{ await using d = null }` inside a block, which
  is how every `awaitUsingDeclarations` test is written, could never reach
  it; one helper is now called from all three). Where a per-call-site fix
  would have meant threading a new field through fourteen save / clear /
  restore sites, the fact went into the DATA instead: TS1115 needs to know
  whether a label is on an iteration statement, and the kind is encoded in
  the label-stack entry so it rides along through an opaque copy.
  **Three of the ten were corpus FALSE POSITIVES first**, and all three
  are the legal-neighbour lesson again. TS1106 is a LOOKAHEAD restriction
  rather than a semantic one — it exists so `for (async of …)` cannot be
  read as the start of `for await (… of …)` — so `for await (async of x)`
  and `for ((async) of x)` are both legal, and the AST cannot tell the
  parenthesized form from the bare one because the binding parser strips
  parens, so the TOKEN is what gets checked. And `export type R = number`
  makes a file a module: the module-syntax evidence set had been built
  from the export shapes that bind a VALUE, so
  `usingDeclarationsDeclarationEmit.2` — TS7-ACCEPTED, two `export type`
  aliases and nothing else — read as a script and its top-level
  `await using` was flagged. The marker now sits at the `export` KEYWORD
  in all three export parsers rather than on the forms that happen to need
  it, because a marker written at the form is a marker written at one of
  them.
  Batch CH is +7 and contains the one rule here a working TypeScript
  programmer hits regularly: `module`, `require`, `process`, `__dirname`
  and six siblings are NOT in the default `lib` set — they come from
  `@types/node` — and all nine sat in the generated lib-global allowlist,
  so a `.ts` file using CommonJS with those types missing was accepted in
  silence (TS2591). The allowlist itself is unchanged, because its seven
  other consumers ask "could the platform have provided this name" and for
  those the conservative answer is still yes; only `check_undefined_name`
  splits the two questions, and only after every declaration lookup has
  run. That rule is also the one that broke a harness nobody thought to
  re-run, and the class of mistake generalizes: a new CHECKER rule is a
  new way for every harness that TYPE-CHECKS ITS OWN FIXTURES to start
  failing, and `verify-mangle-safety` compiles all 185 of its cases
  through `mtsc`. Two of them read `process.argv.length` — deliberately,
  because a literal would be folded away before the passes under test
  ran — so TS2591 turned both into `blocked-compile`, which the corpus
  counts as a REGRESSION. It sat in the branch for eight batches: the
  oracle and the 2,966 tests both stayed green, because neither compiles
  a fixture. The fix is what the diagnostic asks for rather than a
  workaround — `declare const process: { argv: string[] }`, which emits
  nothing, so the value stays Node's and stays opaque to every fold. The
  operational lesson is the checklist: after a rule that can reject a
  NAME, run the fixture-compiling harnesses (`verify-mangle-safety`,
  `verify-generated-fixtures`, `verify-scaffolds`, `verify-examples`,
  `verify-mbti-dts`), not just `moon test` and the oracle.
  It also half-retires a blocker this file records: `TsFunc.body`
  being non-optional really does block TS2393 / TS2394, but
  `last_function_bodiless` already carries the fact at PARSE time, so
  TS2391's pairing question was always answerable there. The way to get it
  wrong is recorded too, because it cost a false positive: a pending run
  of signature names carried across statements gets flushed by
  `parse_stmt`'s view of "the next statement is not a function", which
  includes the statements inside a nested function BODY — so a legal
  three-signature set inside another function was reported the moment the
  implementation's own `return null;` was parsed. A lookahead from the
  signature needs no scope model, where a scope-saved field would have had
  to be threaded through every save/restore site around a function body.
  The same round produced the clearest case yet for pairing a rule with
  its legal neighbour in a TEST rather than trusting the corpus: batch
  CD's TS1117 had shipped a false positive, because `{ … }` in expression
  position is a COVER GRAMMAR — an object literal only until an `=`
  follows, at which point it was an object destructuring PATTERN and
  duplicate names in it are legal. The oracle reported FP 0 with the bug
  present, since `destructuringSameNames` contains illegal spellings too
  and was a TP whichever half fired; the unit suite caught it, because an
  earlier batch had written those three legal shapes down as cases.
  Batch CI is +5 off one rule and one design decision. `++this`,
  `++await 42`, `++1` and the `++(++y)` that ASI makes of
  `x \n ++ \n ++ \n y` are all rejected by tsc and none was flagged; the
  check rides on `record_assign_target_strict_misuse`, the function batch
  BU built for the four write spellings, so there is no fifth place to
  forget. It is a DENYLIST rather than the complementary allowlist on
  purpose: "anything that is not `Var` / `PropAccess` / `IndexAccess`" is
  the correct rule and the wrong implementation, because a target can
  arrive wrapped in nodes that say nothing about writability (`TypeArgs`,
  `As`, `Satisfies`, `PureCall`) and this file already records three
  soundness bugs paid for a wrapper node whose default arm failed open. A
  denylist fails the other way, costing a MISS rather than a false
  positive.
  Batch CJ is +6 and entirely in the LEXER: six rules that were each a
  missing case in a loop which already had an exit for the well-formed
  shape — end of file inside a block comment (TS1010), a radix prefix
  with no digits at all (TS1125, three arms and the rule in none of them,
  because `invalid_radix_digit_count` answers the different question "a
  digit outside this radix"), a keyword spelled with a unicode escape
  (TS1260 — the escape decodes to a legal identifier, so `\u0076ar x = 1`
  scanned as the `var` KEYWORD), a regex crossing a line (TS1161, without
  which `/ b;` scanned to EOF and swallowed the file), and unbalanced
  regex groups (TS1005). The sixth has the only judgement in it: `¬`
  (U+00AC) parsed clean because non-ASCII goes to the identifier scanner,
  which over-approximates ID_Continue as "any code unit >= 0x80" so that
  `変数` and `π` scan as one token. That approximation is right, and
  without a Unicode table "not an identifier character" is what cannot be
  decided in general — so TS1127 covers the one block where the answer is
  knowable (U+00A1..U+00BF plus `×` and `÷`) and excludes the three code
  points in it that ARE ID_Start (`ª`, `µ`, `º`) plus the non-breaking
  space and soft hyphen. Everything from U+00C0 up keeps the permissive
  treatment, so `café` still scans as an identifier.
  Batch CK is +3 and its mistake is worth more than its files. `await` /
  `yield` in an ENUM member initializer needed its own rule because the
  corpus file puts the enum inside an `async function*`, where both
  operators are legal — an enum initializer is a constant-expression
  position, so nothing that suspends belongs in one whatever the
  enclosing function is. The other rule, a legacy decorator on a
  `#private` member, cost TWO corpus false positives first:
  `autoAccessorExperimentalDecorators` combines `accessor` and
  `#private`, gating on `accessor` looked equally plausible, and it
  flagged `@dec accessor prop` and `static accessor y = 1`, both
  TS7-ACCEPTED. The baseline errors on exactly the two PRIVATE members,
  so the private name was doing all the work and the auto-accessor none
  of it — the same substitution as the `computed_props` label and the
  decorator-bucket ranking, reading a two-feature file's error as
  belonging to whichever feature caught the eye first.
  Batch CL is +11 and its most durable output is the ORACLE rather than
  any rule, because it settled two questions the gate cannot reach. The
  first was strategic and had been guesswork: running the whole corpus
  with the permissive filter entirely OFF flags **8 of the 277 MISS
  files** at a cost of 49 false positives, so the suppression was never
  the thing holding recall back — five of those eight are suppressed for
  good reasons and the other 269 files are ones where the checker
  computes nothing at all. The second was per-rule: every
  legal-neighbour claim in this file had been an argument, and
  `scripts/tsc_probe.mjs` makes it a measurement by running the real
  6.0.3 compiler in `node_modules` over a probe file under its own
  `// @option:` header. It earned itself back three times over — `const
  prop = "foo"` versus `let prop = "foo"` is exactly where TS4127's line
  falls (so batch BY's rejection was right, and the rule is now filed
  with its condition rather than its verdict); `namespace M { var Symbol
  … }` is TS2454 while the same line at script top level is not; and
  `symbolProperty37` is in the TS7 error set yet 6.0.3 ACCEPTS it, which
  is why `member_name_duplicates` was left exactly as it was.
  The rules themselves are three more instances of the same two
  families. TS2348 for a class called without `new` needs no inference
  (a class's static side cannot carry a call signature, and neither
  declaration-merging route can add one), and carving it out of the
  "not callable" suppression exposed what that filter had been hiding
  for however long: `is_definitely_not_callable` had an unconditional
  `Object(_) => true` arm, so `declare var q: { (): number }; q()` — an
  object type whose entire purpose is a call signature — was "not
  callable", invisibly, because the family was dropped wholesale. That
  fix has to be asserted through the STRICT entry point, since in
  permissive mode the wrong answer and the right one both look silent.
  `check_static_uses_class_type_params` read a static member's return
  type and parameters, which is where a SIGNATURE carries types and not
  where code does — a static method's BODY and its computed KEY are two
  more positions, and the body is the one real code uses. And
  `record_objlit_duplicate_keys`'s doc comment recorded
  `symbolProperty36` as a deliberate MISS with a blocker (only the class
  key path resolves a well-known symbol to a stable `@@<name>`, and
  renaming the object-literal key would move keys the mangler reads) —
  true of the approach it considered and beside the point, since the
  parser already wraps a computed entry's VALUE as
  `ComputedProp(key_expr, value)` and the key expression was in hand.
  Second time after batch BZ that a stated abstention's own comment
  named the thing to remove.
  Two of the batch's rules were WRONG in their first form and the corpus
  caught both, which is the legal-neighbour lesson twice more. TS2466
  exists for CLASS member keys, so extending it to OBJECT-LITERAL keys
  reads like the applied-in-some-places family and is not: an
  object-literal computed key may legally mention `super`, three
  TS7-ACCEPTED files say so, and it cost 6 false positives for 2 true
  ones. `computedPropertyNames28` is `30` with the object literal
  directly in the constructor instead of inside an arrow, and tsc
  accepts it — modelling a distinction ONE file draws is fitting the
  corpus, so `30` stays a MISS and the reason lives at the site. And IIFE
  arity is one-DIRECTIONAL: a literal callee's parameter list is right
  there in the source, which looked like the same exact fact a function
  declaration gives, and checking both directions cost 4 false positives
  for 1 true one because an IIFE's parameters are contextually typed —
  passing FEWER arguments than parameters is legal and they come out
  `undefined`, which `contextuallyTypedIife` states in a section headed
  "missing arguments". Too many is still TS2554.
  Batch CM is +11 across nine small rules, and its two most useful
  findings are about the PARSER. The ranking came from re-asking the
  question with the CL probe: every remaining MISS file run through the
  real compiler under its own harness header, grouped by the codes it
  actually produced. That is why the rules are small — the top of the
  list is deep type machinery and the long tail is 67 codes with exactly
  ONE file each, mostly grammar. TS2583 (`SharedArrayBuffer` / `Atomics`
  under a pre-es2017 `lib`) is batch CH's TS2591 with a different
  allowlist question; TS2350 is TS2348's mirror, with `Void` / `Any` /
  `Unknown` abstaining and a top-level function DECLARATION excluded by
  NAME rather than by inference, because an old-style JavaScript
  constructor is exactly the `Func` shape and `new Point(1)` is how such
  code is meant to be used; TS1002 is batch CJ's unterminated regex in
  the sibling scanner, where the catch-all arm consumed `\n` and a
  string silently swallowed the rest of the file; TS2432, TS2448 and
  TS18038 are declaration- or flag-shaped and needed no type
  information. TS1200 went in as `Parser::expect_arrow` because
  expression parsing consumes `=>` at EIGHT sites, and the restriction
  had to be probed rather than assumed: a break AFTER the arrow is
  legal, and so is one before a TYPE-position arrow, so `parser_type` is
  untouched. TS2448 was written for BOTH pattern kinds at once —
  `const [a = b, b = 1] = xs` is the same error and was a MISS before
  the generalization.
  The parser findings are two more of the same family, and the first one
  is where the CORPUS said yes and only the full SUITE said no.
  `export import a = A` inside a namespace body records a TYPE alias and
  no value, while the plain `import a = A` spelling records both, and
  that asymmetry is what made TS2708 false-positive on
  `exportImportAlias`. Recording the value there too passed the
  conformance oracle at FP 0 and broke the bridge: the emitter reads
  `values` to decide what to IMPORT, and `export import JSX =
  JSXInternal` over an interface-only namespace is a type-only alias that
  must produce no import at all. Whether the alias binds a value depends
  on the TARGET, which is not resolved at parse time, so neither answer
  serves both consumers — the parser stays as it was and
  `namespace_is_instantiated` reads the fact off `type_aliases`, which
  over-abstains for a namespace of real `export type` aliases and so
  costs a MISS rather than inventing a finding. And a class STATIC BLOCK is the
  fifteenth of fifteen sites that must save / clear / restore
  `self.labels` around a function body, and the only one that did not,
  so `label: while (v) { class C { static { break label } } }` found the
  outer label (TS1107).
  TS2708 also cost a false start worth recording, because it is a
  property of this parser rather than a judgement about TypeScript:
  `parser_namespace_lower` lowers EVERY namespace — instantiated or not
  — to `var N = N || {}`, so at script top level the module env and
  `globals` both bind the name whatever the body holds, and the first
  draft fired only inside a function, where the env holds real locals.
  `ctx.script_top_level` tells the two apart. The same artifact is why a
  type-only namespace NESTED in another is not covered:
  `export namespace inA { … }` records a value for `inA`.
  TS1002 shipped the batch's one PFLEGAL and the corpus named the file:
  U+2028 / U+2029 are line terminators for the grammar and were once
  illegal inside a string literal, but ES2019 made them legal —
  `allowUnescapedParagraphAndLineSeparatorsInStringLiteral` is
  TS7-ACCEPTED. They stay in `scan_regex`'s break, where a regex still
  may not cross one, and are out of `scan_string`'s.
  Two REJECTIONS carry more information than the rules. Wiring
  `unresolved_type_references` into the conformance path is the
  highest-yield-looking gap on the whole list — the function has existed
  for years and is wired into `check_module` ONLY, so `type T =
  Undeclared` is silent while `var q: Undeclared` fires — and it
  produces FORTY-PLUS false positives, because `check_type` carries one
  flat list of type-parameter names that models a declaration's own
  parameters and NOT the binders inside a type (a call signature's own
  `<T>`, an `infer A`, a mapped type's key). And TS6133 for an unused
  `#private` member is deferred on the FAIL DIRECTION rather than the
  effort: every formulation needs a complete walk over the class body or
  a complete reference-recording channel, and a missed read makes the
  member look unused, which is a false positive — the one direction the
  budget does not allow.
  Batch CN is +1 and is mostly about what the probe finds in code that
  is ALREADY there. Writing a TS2610 / TS2611 rule turned up an existing
  one, so the new implementation was deleted and the old one probed —
  which produced three findings. Its two MESSAGES were swapped relative
  to their conditions (the loop for "base accessor, derived property"
  said the opposite), so detection was right and the text was not. Its
  `useDefineForClassFields` gate was WRONG: tsc reports both codes with
  that flag explicitly `false`, because the flag changes how a field is
  EMITTED and not whether changing an inherited member's kind is legal.
  Removing the gate widens the judged population, so it was measured
  alone — TP 2480 / MISS 254 / FP 0, identical to keeping it — and a
  unit test had pinned the wrong behaviour with the confusion stated in
  its own comment ("the property flows through the setter -- allowed"),
  the third test in this repo found asserting the bug. And an AMBIENT
  class's accessors are invisible to the pair, because the parser
  upserts a `declare class`'s `get x(): T` into `properties` with no
  `methods` entry carrying `accessor: "get"` — one defect producing a
  MISS and a latent FALSE POSITIVE at once
  (`declare class A { get x(): string } class B extends A { x = 1 }` is
  TS2610 and silent; the legal accessor-over-accessor form IS reported),
  and the corpus has no file of the second shape, which is why FP 0
  never caught it. Recorded rather than fixed: the change is in the
  parser and moves what the bridge generator sees. The rule that DID
  ship, TS2500, was again a diagnostic the code had already located —
  `parse_implements_names`'s comment names "the `?.` of an invalid
  `implements A?.B`" as the thing it skips — with the asymmetry that
  keeps it sound: `extends A?.B` is legal, since an `extends` clause
  takes an expression.
  Batch CO is +4 and takes MISS to 250, the target. All four came from
  the long tail the compiler-probed ranking exposed — 67 codes with
  exactly ONE miss file each — and none needed type machinery: dot
  access to an index-signature member under
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`, decorators on both halves of a
  get/set pair, a decorator on a bodiless overload, and a CALL in a
  `const enum` initializer. Three of the four cost a false positive
  first, and the three are different failure modes worth separating.
  TS4111's was specific to THIS parser: the flag marker went into
  `grammar_misuses`, where every non-marker entry becomes a diagnostic
  verbatim, so the option's own marker was reported as an error on every
  file carrying it — a marker needs an explicit skip entry or it IS a
  finding. TS1207's was the legal neighbour again, and at scale: seven
  corpus files in `esDecorators/` say that decorating both halves of a
  pair is legal under STANDARD ES decorators, and every probe written
  for the rule had carried `@experimentalDecorators: true`, so not one
  of them could see it. And TS1249's is the one place the new probe
  actively MISLEADS: tsc 6.0.3 reports it for an ambient or abstract
  bodiless member, `decoratorInAmbientContext` is TS7-ACCEPTED, and
  following the local compiler there would have shipped a false
  positive — the caveat `tsc_probe.mjs` states in its own header, now
  with an instance. TS1207 also turned up a pre-existing inconsistency
  it declines to paper over: inside a class EXPRESSION body the
  decorator-mode flag is not reliable, since
  `(class E { @dec get x() {…} @dec set x(v) {…} })` with NO directive
  fires while the identical declaration stays silent, so some parser on
  that path carries `experimental_decorators`' `true` default instead of
  the header value. Every decorator-mode-gated rule is wrong there; the
  expression form is skipped and the fix is filed.
  Batches CP and CQ are **+28** together for seventeen rules, and CP's two most useful outputs
  are a REJECTION with a measured cause and a performance bug I wrote
  myself. Ten of the rules are grammar or lexer or flag-shaped and needed
  no type information: TS1489 (a leading-zero literal an `8` or `9` makes
  decimal — the other exit of the branch that already recorded the legacy
  octal), TS17006 (a unary expression as the left operand of `**`, where
  `++t ** 2` is legal because an UpdateExpression is), TS5076 (`??` mixed
  with `||` or `&&`), TS1186 (a rest element with an initializer, at BOTH
  of its sites), TS1347 (a `"use strict"` prologue with a non-simple
  parameter list), TS17013 (`new.target` outside any function), TS1036 (a
  bare `;` in a `.d.ts`), TS2354 (`@importHelpers` with a `using`),
  TS18016 (a `#private` name with no enclosing class body) and TS2390
  (constructor signatures with no implementation). Three needed a
  structural fact instead.
  Four of them are the applied-in-some-places family again, and one is
  its inverse. TS1186's two spellings land in different parsers, and the
  abstention comment in `parse_assignment_binding_array` named the
  blocker in writing — `[...x = a] = a` parses as an EXPRESSION, so the
  array-literal arm of `parse_assignment` is where it had to go, while
  `var [...z = a] = a` really is the binding parser's. TS2390 is the
  mirror image of a rule that already existed: `ctor_impl_count` had
  counted constructor implementations for years and only ever been
  compared against 2, so two implementations were reported and ZERO were
  not. TS4113's recording sat inside `if method_name != "<computed>"`,
  a guard that is right for the three lists it wraps — accessibility and
  abstractness are looked up by NAME — and wrong for the fourth, which
  only asks whether a member carried `override`. And
  `resolve_base_chain_members` consulted a merged interface ONLY when no
  class of that name existed, which is never, since a merge has both
  halves. The inverse case is TS1036: `Empty` looked like a missing arm
  in the ambient-statement list and is a deliberate abstention, because
  an `interface`, a `type` alias, a bodiless `declare function` and a
  skipped namespace all lower to the same `Empty` — putting it in that
  list would fire on nearly every real `.d.ts`, so the parser marks the
  real `;` instead.
  TS4113 is also where a recorded REJECTION became a rule with a
  condition. Batch BY refused `override` on a computed name as unsound,
  and was right: a `const` string key is late-bindable, so
  `override [prop]()` is LEGAL when the base declares what `prop`
  resolves to. What IS decidable without resolving the key is a base
  chain that declares NOTHING AT ALL — and getting that claim to be true
  rather than merely unobserved took two fixes, the merged-interface fold
  above and a `has_opaque` flag, because a computed key in the BASE is a
  member the walk cannot name. The first draft fired on
  `interface M { m(): void }` beside `class M {}`, which tsc does report
  — and would have fired identically had M declared `foo`, where it is
  legal. "It agrees with tsc on this file" is not soundness either.
  The REJECTION is `unresolved_type_references`, which this file called
  the highest-yield-looking gap on the list, and the cause is now
  measured rather than guessed. Four of the things batch CL blamed are
  real and are FIXED: the `__tsmbt_infer` marker was reported as a type,
  an `infer` name was unresolved in the conditional's branches, `note`
  consulted a forty-name hand list where the GENERATED
  `is_lib_global_type` registry exists, and `module_declared_name_set`
  ignored `imported_binding_names` — whose own doc comment names
  unresolved-reference checks as its consumer. None of that is the
  blocker. An interface or object-type CALL / CONSTRUCT signature's own
  type parameters are not preserved anywhere `check_type` can read them,
  so `interface I { <U>(x: U): U }` reports `U` through the `Object` /
  `Func` arms the walk has always had: the binder is lost by the PARSER.
  Adding scope arms for `GenericFunc` and the mapped types was tried and
  made it worse — those nodes were previously SKIPPED, and walking them
  turned silent MISSes into reports of their own parameters, which is the
  general lesson: a walk arm added to a skipped node converts a MISS into
  a candidate false positive, the one direction the budget forbids.
  The performance bug is worth as much as any rule. TS5076 has to
  distinguish `(a && b) ?? c` from `a && b ?? c`, and the parser strips
  parens, so the check reads the TOKEN range the expression consumed —
  the same reasoning batch CF's TS1106 records. But `parse_or` runs once
  per expression at that precedence level, for every expression in the
  file, nested, so scanning unconditionally is O(n^2) in the token count.
  It took a 9 MB file from seconds to over 180, and the checker whitebox
  binary sat at 100% CPU for 36 minutes before anyone looked at `ps`.
  Gating the scan on the frame having actually consumed a `??` makes the
  cost proportional to the nullish expressions instead of to the file;
  the oracle's own wall time (58 s over 4,484 files) is the check that it
  is gone. A rule that reads a span is a rule with a cost model, and the
  span-reading idiom this file recommends does not come with one.
  Two more probe findings, both of which would have been wrong if
  reasoned about. `"use strict"` with a non-simple parameter list is an
  error only from **es2016** up — below that TypeScript downlevels the
  parameter, so the EMITTED list is simple — and a file with no
  `@target:` at all is left alone even though tsc 6.0.3 reports it,
  because that says what the local compiler's default target is and
  nothing about TS7's. And `abstract class C { constructor(); }` IS
  TS2390, which "abstract members have no bodies" suggests it should not
  be; only an ambient class is exempt, and the parser routes
  `declare class` through a different function entirely, so that
  exemption needs no code.
  Batch CQ is the other nine files, and three of its four rules were
  wrong in their first form for three different reasons. TS1212's message
  names strict mode and tsc applies it REGARDLESS — `yield;`,
  `console.log(yield)`, `var yield = 1`, a parameter named `yield` and a
  bare `let` are all reported at es5 in a sloppy script — so batch CF's
  assumption that these are strict-mode-only reservations was too narrow;
  the rule sits at the two identifier-REFERENCE arms, and every property
  position (`{ yield: 1 }`, `o.let`, `interface I { let: string }`,
  `enum E { yield }`, `class C { yield() {} }`) is legal and parsed
  elsewhere, which is what keeps it off them. TS2803 and TS2806 turned
  out to EXIST already, and probing them is what explained the two
  corpus MISSes: those checks read `module_.classes`, so they cannot see
  `const C = class { … }`, which is the shape both files use — so the new
  code is gated to the class EXPRESSION and a declaration is left
  entirely to the older rules rather than reported twice. Second time
  after batch CN that writing a rule turned up the rule already there,
  and the same resolution: probe the old one, do not keep a second.
  TS7008 shipped TWO false positives and the boundary is exact: a member
  with no annotation and no initializer takes its type from an assignment
  in the CONSTRUCTOR or a STATIC BLOCK, and NOT from one in a method
  body. `classStaticBlockUseBeforeDef1` is `static x;` plus
  `static { this.x = 1 }`. Telling those regions apart in a flat token
  scan needs brace tracking, so any `.name =` in the body withdraws the
  report — which loses `class B { q; m() { this.q = 1 } }` and is the
  MISS that buys FP 0. Its diagnostic also had to be taught to print
  `#u` rather than `__private_brand__4__u`: `class_key_name` returns the
  MANGLED name, and a diagnostic naming a brand is one nobody can act
  on. The private rules read the class body's TOKEN range rather than
  walking member bodies, for the reason the perf note above cuts both
  ways: a body is an arbitrary expression tree and a walker missing one
  arm loses findings silently, while every access to `#x` must spell
  `#x`, so a scan is complete by construction — and here the span is one
  class body, not one expression per frame, so it carries no quadratic
  term. And a fifth test was found asserting a gap: the TS1128 ASI case
  (`class C { var\n public }`) expected silence, and both of those are
  real TS7008s under a flag that defaults ON, so the assertion was
  measuring the implicit-any hole rather than the ASI behaviour it is
  named for.
  Batch CR is +3 and is the family in its purest form yet, twice over in
  one rule. TS2307 reads `import_module_specs`, and that list was filled
  by the IMPORT parsers only — so `export * as ns from './nonexistent'`
  reached the check with nothing to say even though the specifier was
  sitting right there. Routing the eight `expect_from()` sites through
  one `expect_from_spec` helper fixed half of them, and
  `export { a } from './nope'` STILL did not report: this parser consumes
  `from` in TWO ways, a mandatory `expect_from` and an optional
  `match_(From) || match_ident("from")` (because `export { a }` with no
  `from` is legal), and the first fix covered one of the two. Six more
  sites use the optional spelling; both helpers now record through a
  single `record_module_spec`, which is the only place that writes the
  list. An import TYPE's specifier was a third route — that arm consumed
  and discarded it — and buys no corpus file, because
  `importTypeAmbientMissing`'s only top-level declaration is a
  `declare module`, so the whole check is suppressed by the
  ambient-module-bundle gate; it ships anyway, proven in isolation,
  because a typo in `import("...")` is an error a person makes.
  TS6133 for an unused `#private` is the other rule, and it is the one
  place a COUNTING argument replaces a walk. An earlier note deferred it
  on the fail direction: every formulation needs a complete walk or a
  complete reference channel, and a missed read makes a used member look
  unused, which is a false positive. Counting inverts that. A private
  name is class-scoped, so every read must spell `#name`, which makes
  the number of `PrivateIdent` tokens carrying it an exact upper bound on
  declarations + reads; when that does not exceed the declaration count
  the class parsers recorded, nothing reads it. A read this misses is
  impossible, and an extra occurrence only makes it quieter. It is
  file-level rather than per-class deliberately —
  `privateNameUnused` declares `#unused` four times across three classes
  (a get/set pair being two declarations of one member) and reads it
  never, while its `#used` has the same four declarations plus three
  reads — and a `#x in v` brand check IS a read to tsc, which is exactly
  why `privateNameInInExpressionUnused` reports its `#unused` and not
  its `#brand`.
  Batch CS is +3 and its most valuable output is a FALSE POSITIVE the
  conformance gate structurally cannot see. Hunting for a mechanism worth
  many files, three plausible ones were tested and all three came back
  negative, which is worth as much as the rules: **position coverage is
  not the bottleneck** (a matrix of a known type error in each of 28
  syntactic positions — return, property assignment, array element,
  for-of head, default parameter, template, index write, satisfies, … —
  finds 24 already checked); a NAME is not a feature cluster (the 21
  `Symbol`-ish miss files need 21 unrelated things — instanceof operands,
  for-in operands, interface extends conflicts, `delete` on readonly,
  index types, the async-iterator protocol); and the lib model is
  largely present (8 of 13 common global return types infer correctly).
  So there is no single mechanism worth ~66 files, and the measured rate
  is about 1.7 rules per file gained.
  The one real systemic gap found was `Symbol()` having no model in
  `infer_expr` — `iterator_class_element_type`'s own comment says so and
  worked around it locally, another stated abstention naming its blocker
  — and giving it one is what makes every symbol-operand rule reachable.
  On top of that: TS2358 extended from a syntactic literal LHS to the
  inferred type, TS2359 for the right operand, TS2407 for a `for...in`
  right-hand side, TS2731 for a symbol in a template substitution (zero
  corpus files, kept because `${sym}` THROWS at runtime), and TS18046
  for an unnarrowed `catch (e)` — the single most common thing a
  codebase hits when it turns `strict` on, decided by a token scan of
  the catch block where any of five narrowing spellings withdraws the
  report.
  The false positive is the lesson. `+`, `-` and `~` all apply
  ToNumeric, so the ONLY type TypeScript refuses is `symbol` (TS2469) —
  `~aString`, `-aString`, `~aBoolean` and `-aBoolean` are legal and were
  all being reported, and an object coerces too. Probing operator by
  operator was the only way to find it, because the BINARY operators
  really do require a number (`s - 1` is TS2362) and `++` / `--` really
  do too (TS2356), so the wrong rule looked like its neighbours. Two
  TESTS asserted the bug by name ("unary minus on string is flagged",
  "unary minus still rejects a string operand") — the sixth and seventh
  in this repo found doing that. And the gate paid for the wrong rule
  with a right-looking number: removing it COST a true positive, because
  `typeArgumentsWithStringLiteralTypes01` was flagged only for
  `args[+randBool()]` — idiomatic bool-to-0/1 coercion — while its real
  errors are five TS2345s elsewhere. A conformance file counts as a TP
  if we flag it AT ALL, so +1 TP is not evidence that a rule is right.
  Batches CT-CZ are **+23 files** (MISS 250 -> 193) and the ranking
  behind them was made by running every remaining MISS file through the
  local compiler and grouping the codes it actually produced. That
  ranking is also the answer to "what would a big win look like": 132 of
  208 files have exactly ONE error code, 103 codes have exactly one file,
  and the four largest — TS2322 (14 solo), TS2345 (10), TS2339 (7),
  TS2403 (5) — are variadic tuples, template-literal types, conditional
  types and contextual typing, fourteen unrelated causes when the files
  are opened. There is no mechanism left worth many files; the rate is
  three to five files per probed batch.
  What DOES still pay is the applied-in-some-places family, and CU is the
  clearest instance yet because the rule was not merely similar to an
  existing one, it WAS one. `check_class_decorator_signatures` has
  compared a CLASS decorator's declared arity against the runtime's for
  years and the member positions had nothing, so `@dec prop` with a
  one-parameter `dec` was silent. Its arity table had to be PROBED,
  because "a signature with fewer parameters is assignable" is not what
  tsc does: a property decorator must ACCEPT exactly 2 arguments and a
  method or accessor decorator 2 or 3, where accept means N falls in the
  signature's `[min, max]` range. Two things nearly cost false
  positives. An `accessor` FIELD is decorated like a METHOD — its
  decorator gets a descriptor — so `decoratorOnClassProperty13` was
  reported until the stage-3 modifier reached the classification point,
  which is the OPPOSITE conclusion from batch CK, where gating on
  `accessor` was the wrong reading of a two-feature file. And
  `is_optional` is accurate for a `function` declaration and always
  FALSE for an ambient `declare function`, whose synthesized parameter
  list carries names and types only, so reading it alone made `@dec`
  with `(target, key?, desc?)` — how a universal decorator is written,
  and an existing test's assertion — report "expects 3". Consulting the
  parameter TYPE as well over-counts optionals and therefore only ever
  WIDENS the accepted range.
  CV is one parser defect with TWO faces, and the second is a false
  positive the gate structurally cannot see. `parse_declare_class`
  upserted a `declare class`'s `get x(): T` into `properties` and pushed
  no `methods` entry carrying the `get` tag, so every consumer asking
  "is this base member an accessor or a data property" got the wrong
  answer for an ambient base: `declare class A { get x(): string }`
  beside `class B extends A { x = 1 }` is TS2610 and was SILENT, while
  the LEGAL accessor-over-accessor form was reported TWICE. The corpus
  has no file of the second shape, which is why FP 0 never caught it —
  the fix is to mirror what the runtime class parser already does (both
  records, not one) so the two paths cannot disagree again.
  CW's TS2678 is the family with the two spellings inside one check.
  The switch case-comparability test has flagged
  `switch ("a") { case "b": }` for as long as it existed and
  `switch (12) { case 5: }` was silent, because `infer_expr` keeps
  `Literal("a")` for a string literal expression and WIDENS a numeric one
  to `number` and a boolean one to `boolean`. Reading the two literals
  off the SYNTAX needs no inference and cannot be defeated by widening;
  a `const` scrutinee stays a MISS, since its literal type is exactly
  what widening removes.
  CX's TS2415 / TS2417 is where probing earned itself back outright. The
  message says "different accessibility modifiers", which reads as "they
  must match", and the 3x3 table on both the static and instance sides
  says otherwise: widening `protected` to `public` is LEGAL, and an
  identical `private` redeclaration is an ERROR, because a base private
  member is nominal and nothing outside the declaring class can satisfy
  it. Those are the two cells a rule written from the message text gets
  wrong in opposite directions.
  CY is the family in the TREE rather than in a check, and it is the
  reason "record the fact in one place" is not by itself enough.
  `export { … }` is parsed at FOUR sites; a recorder deliberately written
  at three of them still left a top-level `export { x };` silent, because
  that site reached for `parse_import_specifiers` instead of
  `parse_named_exports` — two functions parsing one clause. Fixing it
  corrected something smaller underneath: that site pushed the clause's
  names into `imported_binding_names`, which is a list of LOCAL BINDINGS
  an import introduces, and `export { x }` introduces none. The
  mislabelling is what made the check quiet, since the undeclared name
  looked declared. CY's TS2532 also shipped a false positive first, and
  the trap was already written down: `Undefined` looked like it belonged
  in the arm next to `Void`, and our flow model narrows an `any`-typed
  binding to `Undefined` when its initializer is `undefined`, so
  `const q: any = undefined; const { y }: any = q` — which tsc ACCEPTS —
  was reported. `check_computed_key_type` documents that exact hazard
  twenty lines in, for the same reason, which is why one of them should
  have warned about the other. `Void` cannot be produced by narrowing.
  Two rules were REJECTED with their conditions recorded rather than
  their verdicts. TS2464 for a bare `Symbol` as a computed key is
  correct and buys zero corpus files, because `symbolProperty3` writes
  `var s = Symbol; ({ [s]: 0 })` and `s` infers as `Any` — catching it
  needs the constructor modelled as a value type, and neither spelling
  is code anyone writes. And TS2347's first form asked whether the
  callee's type comes out `Any`, which is true both for a genuine `any`
  and for every type this checker FAILED to compute: `const C = foo()`
  where `foo` returns a class expression is `Any` here and a generic
  class in tsc (`staticIndexSignature6`), so that version was +6 TP and
  1 FP, four of the six flagged for a reason that does not hold. What is
  decidable without inference is a declaration with no `=` initializer
  whose annotation is `any` or absent, which loses `const p =
  JSON.parse('{}'); p<number>(1)` — a real TS2347 — and that MISS is
  what buys FP 0.
  Every gate above asks whether the answer is RIGHT, and none of them can
  see a rule's COST: the oracle's 4,484 files are a few dozen lines each,
  so a rule quadratic in the number of interfaces or exports in ONE file
  is invisible to it and to the 2,966 tests alike. `just
  verify-checker-scaling` asks the missing question the only way a cost
  model can be asked — by GROWTH rather than by stopwatch. It runs a size
  ladder along each axis a check loops over (interfaces, merged
  interfaces, classes, exports, aliases, enums, vars) and fits an
  exponent from the endpoints: linear is ~1.0, quadratic ~2.0, and an
  axis over budget fails the run and NAMES the axis, which is the part a
  wall-clock reading cannot tell you. Its `same-bytes` control is what
  separates the two diagnoses: bytes grow with the rung and the
  declaration count does not, so "the big file is slow" and "the long
  list is slow" stop looking alike — and that is what proved the
  regression below was about the COUNT rather than the 527 KB.
  It was written because batches CY–DB were **6.5x slower at 4,000
  interfaces** than the batch before them, at FP 0, with every test
  green. Three nested scans over module-wide lists, all landing at once:
  `check_merged_interface_member_conflicts` compared every (i, j) pair of
  interfaces in the module to find the same-NAMED ones (72M iterations on
  a 12,000-interface file, for a rule that can only act on same-named
  pairs); `check_merged_export_modifiers` rescanned both declaration
  lists per exported name; and both joined member lists as fields x
  fields. Each is the same fix — an index where a nested scan was — and
  the ladder went from 998 ms to 166 ms at the top rung, back to 0.99x of
  the pre-batch code. Two of the batch's own doc comments had described
  these loops accurately; what neither said was what they cost.
  The harness then earned itself back on its FIRST run, twice. It found a
  quadratic the fix had missed — grouping by name killed the module-wide
  n² and left a pair loop INSIDE each group, which is exactly what an
  `interface Window` spread over many halves is (5.0 s at N=4,000).
  Accumulating the first-seen type per member is one pass, and it is also
  what tsc's message describes ("must be of type `T`", where `T` is the
  FIRST declaration's), so the faster rule is the more faithful one; it
  can only lose a finding where `types_definitely_differ` abstains on
  (first, later) but would have proven (later, later'), which is the
  affordable direction. And it found a SECOND quadratic that predated the
  whole batch series: `merge_interfaces` is pairwise and the upsert loop
  filling `r.interfaces` used it as a left FOLD, copying the accumulated
  arrays once per declaration. That one is worth recording for the
  measurement rather than the fix — the largest same-name group in
  `lib.dom.d.ts` is **2**, and 11 across the entire lib set concatenated,
  so it had never cost anything and never would. It was fixed anyway
  because it is the honest reason the axis reported a 2.0 exponent, and a
  known quadratic left in place is one the next person has to
  re-diagnose; `merge_interface_group` is a single pass whose equivalence
  to the fold is asserted field by field against the fold itself, on a
  four-declaration group carrying every shape that could tell them apart
  (a member redeclared by a later half, a member declared twice in one
  body, a dedup list and an append-only one). 5,053 ms -> 29.6 ms, and
  42x faster than the code that predates the batches.
  What the round did NOT find is worth as much: the parser is untouched
  by 40 batches of new markers (0.94–1.05x, including the 9 MB
  `typescript.js`), and the residual on real files is 0.92–1.02x — so
  fifty new rules cost nothing measurable on a real `.d.ts`. The per-axis
  differential says why there is nothing left to chase: interfaces +11%,
  aliases +20%, exports +5%, classes −5%, enums −8%, vars −1%. The cost
  is spread proportionately across fifty rules with no single one to
  attribute, which is the shape a linear checker should have, and the
  20% on a 3.8 MB concatenation of every lib file is the whole price.
  Every number above ranks work by CORPUS COUNT, and
  `docs/checker-triage.md` is where that stops: `MISS 176` sums work
  worth doing now with files nobody should ever fix, so it can rank
  nothing and can never reach zero — the defect that retired
  `docs/checker-priority.md`. All 176 are classified there by the
  MACHINERY a rule needs, priced against how often the feature appears
  in 3,000 real `.d.ts` files and 2,697 real `.ts` sources, and assigned
  four tiers with the reason written down. Two measurements decide two
  tiers outright: `using` declarations occur in **zero** of 5,697 real
  files and are 6 of the misses, and the 48-file assignability bucket is
  ~10 unrelated causes, so the largest bucket ranks no work — the same
  label-for-objective substitution recorded four times above.
  Its most useful output is a CAPABILITY PROBE, because the
  classification says what a file NEEDS and not what we HAVE, and
  guessing at that was wrong twice in one session. Probed against
  `tscheck --strict`: mapped types, `keyof`, strictNullChecks,
  `this`-types, index signatures, variadic tuples, generic function
  inference and basic assignability are all CAUGHT at the common shape,
  while conditional-via-generic-alias, the whole utility-type table,
  template-literal types with a placeholder, computed `unique symbol`
  keys and overload resolution were BLIND at the shape real code writes.
  The first probe run reported every family blind and that was harness
  error, not a finding: these entry points check function BODIES and the
  probes put the error at top level, where nothing visits it.
  Batches DI–DM took the Tier 1 rows and every one was the
  applied-in-some-places family, four levels deep in the same feature.
  `Resolver::unwrap` reduces `Keyof`, `TypeOf`, `MappedType`,
  `IndexedAccess` and `TemplateLiteralType` and had **no `Conditional`
  arm**; the evaluator itself works, since an inline conditional and a
  non-generic alias for one both resolve — only the composition with a
  generic alias abstained. `standard_utility_types()` had been
  unit-tested for years behind `module_alias_resolver`, a `pub fn` with
  **no caller outside its own file and its tests**, so a `.d.ts` using
  `ReturnType<typeof f>` type-checked BY ABSTAINING. `simplify_type`
  decides through the three-valued `extends_decision`, which cannot bind
  an `infer`, and `reduce_conditional` — the reducer that can — was
  reachable from `is_assignable_to` and not from alias resolution. And
  `contains_infer_marker` descended into `Func` with no `Constructor`
  arm, so `new (...args) => infer R` never ran the infer path at all,
  while `match_infer_pattern` and `substitute_inferred_type` both
  handled `Constructor` already: two of the trio right, the GATE wrong.
  Three of those took a wrong diagnosis first, and the corrections are
  the reusable part. `typeof C` really does arrive unresolved (the
  `TypeOf` arm reads `globals`, a class lives in `classes`) and was NOT
  why `InstanceType` was inert — `InstanceType<new () => C>`, with no
  `typeof` anywhere, was equally silent, and that inline case is kept as
  a test precisely because it is what distinguishes the gate from the
  class lookup. Wiring the WHOLE utility table in was wrong: the
  property-shape entries (`Partial`, `Record`, `Pick`, …) already have
  dedicated `lookup_field` arms and resolving them here moved the shape
  out from under those arms — three real regressions, not tests pinning
  old behaviour. The fallback is gated on the body being a `Conditional`,
  a SHAPE test rather than a name list, because a second copy of those
  names is the defect the batch removes. And the conformance gate caught
  a false positive the moment the resolver read that table:
  `ThisType<T>` is `interface ThisType<T> {}` in `lib.es5.d.ts`, an
  EMPTY marker, while the table encodes it as the identity and says why
  in its own comment — that is the useful answer to "what is `this`
  here", a different question from "what members does this type have",
  and the identity answer used structurally makes
  `PropDesc<U> & ThisType<T>` demand every member of `T`.
  The ceiling is honest about itself: DI, DK and DM buy **zero** corpus
  files each and DJ and DL buy one apiece, which is what the triage
  predicted in writing ("take these for the capability, not the count").
  What they buy instead is that `Exclude` / `Extract` / `NonNullable` /
  `ReturnType` / `Parameters` / `Awaited` / `InstanceType` /
  `ConstructorParameters` now decide, an index signature constrains the
  MERGED interface rather than one declaration of it, and an overloaded
  call's arguments are checked at all — they were checked by NOTHING,
  because `check_union_callee_arity` is correctly excluded from overload
  sets (every member must accept, right for a union VALUE and wrong for
  an overload set) and nothing took over. Two of the five cost a false
  positive whose hazard was already written down twenty lines away, both
  about optionality widened into a parameter type.
  The one Tier 1 row that did not survive contact is the `unique symbol`
  cluster, and the label was mine: opening all 16 files gives ELEVEN
  distinct error codes. Two are already rejected with measured evidence,
  two need overload resolution, two need lib interface merging, two need
  block-scope resolution of a shadowed `Infinity`, and the rest are one
  unrelated thing each — so the one genuinely cheap file turned out not
  to be a symbol rule at all. Recorded in TODO.md so the 16 are not
  re-attacked as a group.
  The triage's own headline is now the gate rather than a
  recommendation, and implementing it corrected the triage twice.
  `scripts/checker_out_of_scope.txt` declares the Tier 4 paths with a
  kind and a reason each, the oracle splits the MISS bucket into
  **`MISS in scope` 157** (the backlog, which can reach zero) beside
  **`OUT OF SCOPE` 17** (declared), and `verify-checker-soundness` gates
  the first with `--max-miss` — which closes a direction NOTHING
  watched, since a rule that stops firing moves a file from TP to MISS
  and every other number in the report absorbs that silently. The FP
  budget is untouched: only the MISS branch consults the file, so a
  listed file can still be a TP, an FP or a PFLEGAL, and
  `--scope-file /dev/null` reproduces the old single 174 (verified, not
  asserted). The estimate was ~24 files and the answer is 17, because
  the estimate came from the family classifier and the 17 came from
  OPENING each file: `parser/ecmascript5/` holds ordinary current
  TypeScript beside the error-recovery corpus, so twelve "legacy" files
  are six (`parserExportAssignment6` is an undefined-name check inside
  `declare module`, `parserES5SymbolProperty4` is a lib member lookup,
  and two more have parse-ambiguity PURPOSES with ordinary
  DIAGNOSTICS — a distinction the directory cannot make); and a file
  NAMED for `using` can carry an error `using` has nothing to do with,
  since `usingDeclarationsWithObjectLiterals2` is TS7018 on
  `value: null`, which a plain `const` reproduces under the same two
  flags. Sixth and seventh instances of the label-for-objective
  substitution, this time in a document written to warn about it. The
  one mechanism that keeps a scope file from decaying into a suppression
  list is a report of STALE entries — a listed path that is no longer a
  MISS, proven by adding a bogus path and seeing it named.
  Batch DN takes the first three Tier 2 files — the three the scope
  review just moved OUT of Tier 4 — and its TS2371 is the
  applied-in-some-places family in its strongest form yet: the rule was
  not merely similar to an existing one, it WAS one, living as a LOCAL
  function at the two bodiless exits of `parse_function_decl` and
  inline through a second channel for interface members, with the CLASS
  path holding nothing — so `class C { foo(a = 4); foo(a, b) {} }`
  parsed clean. Hoisted to one recorder. The rule is about the BODY and
  nothing else, which is what makes it decidable in the parser, so the
  test is `has_body_block` and not the modifiers; every bodiless
  position was probed (overload signature, `abstract`, `declare class`,
  `interface`, object type, function TYPE, `declare function`) and all
  seven report, while the legal spellings are the two the message names
  plus an ARROW — whose body is what follows the `=>`, which is exactly
  what a class field holding `(a = 1) => a` is. TS2394's arity half is
  where probing earned itself back again: the rule is
  ONE-DIRECTIONAL and the message ("not compatible with its
  implementation signature") does not say which direction, so the table
  was probed cell by cell. An implementation that requires MORE
  arguments than a signature can supply is the error; a SHORTER
  implementation is LEGAL (`m(a); m() {}`, `m(a, b); m(a) {}`), because
  a function with fewer parameters is assignable to one with more. Four
  of the eight silent cases in the new test are what a rule written
  from the message text alone would have flagged — the same failure
  mode as TS2415/TS2417, where "different accessibility modifiers"
  reads as "they must match" and two cells go wrong in opposite
  directions.
  Batch DO is +4 for three findings, two of them about code already
  present, and its most useful output is what the FIRST version cost.
  TS7009 is TS2350's rule with one exclusion removed, and the FLAG
  decides which of the two applies: with `noImplicitAny` off `new f()`
  errors iff `f`'s return is not `void`, and with it on there is no
  exemption at all — tsc reports even `function Point(x) { this.x = x };
  new Point(1)`, which is the case CLAUDE.md had recorded as the reason
  for the exclusion. That `resolver.signatures` early return excluded
  every top-level function DECLARATION **by name, before any type was
  consulted**, which was REDUNDANT for TS2350 (an old-style
  constructor's return is `void`, which the return-type predicate
  abstains on anyway) and was the only thing blocking TS7009. Removed
  unrestricted it is +2 corpus files and **5 false positives**, because
  the parser lowers a class declared INSIDE a function to a function —
  so `function outer() { class A { x = 1 } return new A() }` arrives as
  a `Func` and is a legal `new`. TS7009 therefore needs POSITIVE
  evidence where TS2350 could lean on abstention (a top-level function
  declaration, or a WRITTEN call-signature object type), which is +1 at
  FP 0: the file given up was flagged for the unsound reason. Probing
  that also measured a defect this file had only assumed — every
  CHECKER-level class rule is blind to a class declared inside a
  function (TS2420, TS2415 and TS2564 all fire at top level and none
  nested), while batch DN's parser-level TS2394 fires in both, because
  `record_runtime_class_decl`'s stash is taken only by the module-level
  dispatcher.
  The second rule is one arm of `infer_expr` that answered for fifteen
  operators: a compound assignment's value is its RIGHT-HAND SIDE for
  the twelve arithmetic and bitwise ones and NOT for `&&=`, since
  `a &&= b` is `a && (a = b)` and the result is `a` when `a` is falsy.
  So `(results &&= []).push(100)` stays possibly `undefined` (TS2532)
  while the same line spelled `||=` or `??=` is legal — the operator has
  already removed the nullish part there, so widening those would report
  the legal spellings. It needed a second change, and the abstention it
  relaxes states its own reason: the strictNullChecks member-access
  checks are gated to a bare `Var` receiver because those are the
  bindings the narrowing engine rewrites precisely. A `&&=` receiver
  qualifies for the OPPOSITE reason — there is no narrowing to get
  wrong, and the target is inferred through the same `env`, so a guard
  that narrowed it is already in the union.
  The third finding came from probing a LEGAL neighbour for that rule
  and is a pre-existing false positive no gate could see: `+=`'s
  string-concatenation exemption tested for `String_` EXACTLY, so
  `let t = ""` — whose type here is the literal `""`, because tsc widens
  it and we do not — demanded a numeric target and reported ordinary
  string building. Asking assignability widens the EXEMPTION and can
  only lose a finding. Removing it COST two TPs, which is batch CS's
  lesson with the sign flipped: `parserRealSource1`/`2` were flagged for
  `result += "\t"` and nothing else, while their real TS7 error is the
  TS6053 that already put `parserRealSource3` out of scope. A conformance
  file counts as a TP if we flag it AT ALL, so −2 TP is not evidence a
  fix is wrong; they are declared out of scope now, and `--max-miss`,
  added one batch earlier, is what surfaced them — the gate earning
  itself back on its first real use.
  Batch DP closes the defect DO measured: `TsModule.classes` is filled
  by the module-level statement dispatcher, the only thing that took the
  parser's `last_runtime_class_decl` stash, so a class declared in a
  function body was recorded nowhere a rule could read and every
  CHECKER-level class rule was silent at every depth but zero. The
  parser collects those into `local_classes` and the checker merges the
  two at ONE entry point, which is what gives all ~58
  `module_.classes` loops the classes without touching any of them;
  `check_module` is excluded because its first act is a
  duplicate-declaration scan across every top-level kind. Worth +1
  corpus file and the capability at four nesting positions (function
  body, block, `if` branch, arrow body).
  **The merge cost four false positives before it was right, and all
  four are one mistake**: `module_.classes` does not mean "the classes",
  it means "the classes with no enclosing scope", and three rules depend
  on the second reading. The resolver's NAME table must not learn a
  block-scoped name — a nested `class C` beside `let C = f(10)` made
  `new C(20)` resolve to the class and fail its constructor arity
  (`localTypes2`/`3`). `new A()` inside a class nested in A's own method
  is legal, and A's method body is already scanned with
  `enclosing = "A"`, so scanning the nested class as top level reported
  the same expression twice (`classConstructorAccessibility4`). And
  `check_private_member_access` states its premise in its own doc
  comment — "nested class bodies are skipped, their accesses may legally
  reach an outer class's privates" — which the merge broke exactly
  (`privateNameComputedPropertyName3`). So `TsClassDecl` carries
  `is_local`, those three consumers test it and the other fifty-five do
  not; a name already declared at top level is skipped so
  `function f() { class A {} } class A {}` is not a duplicate. Linear:
  a hand ladder of N classes-inside-functions is 32/62/130/267 ms at
  500/1000/2000/4000, exponent 1.02. The remainder is stated rather than
  chased — a nested class whose BASE is also nested cannot resolve its
  base chain, which loses a finding rather than inventing one.
  Batch DQ is the same defect on a second axis, and probing is what
  made it worth taking: TS2420 / TS2415 / TS2564 all fire on a class
  DECLARATION, on `declare class` AND on a namespace-scoped class, and
  on `const C = class …` not one of them did — while a class expression
  is how a mixin, a HOC and a decorated factory class are all written.
  `parse_class_stub` records into `local_classes` from **both** of its
  exits, which is the finding rather than the fix: the native
  `NativeClassExpr` exit is taken ONLY when there is an `extends`
  clause, and a base-less class expression falls through to the desugar
  below it, so recording at the first alone bought exactly the one rule
  that needs a base — TS2415 fired, the other two stayed silent, and
  that asymmetry is what exposed the split. An anonymous class
  expression gets a PER-OCCURRENCE synthetic name, not one shared
  `<class expression>`: the merge skips a repeated name, so a shared one
  would check only the first anonymous class in a file and a file with
  several is the normal case. +3 corpus files.
  Its one false positive is DP's lesson on a fifth axis and the sharpest
  version of it: TS2449 ("class used before its declaration") compares
  INDICES in `module_.classes`, which encode top-level source ORDER —
  and a local class is appended, so its index is not a position at all.
  Read as one it made every top-level class whose base shares a name
  with a class expression look forward-referencing
  (`accessorsOverrideProperty8`, where `const Base =
  classWithProperties(…, class Base {})` sits beside `class MyClass
  extends Base`). Exempting local classes on both sides costs the mirror
  MISS — `const D = class extends B {}; class B {}` IS TS2449 and stays
  quiet — which is the affordable half. So `module_.classes` turns out
  to carry THREE meanings its consumers read separately: the set of
  classes, the set with no enclosing scope, and their source order.
  Batch DR is three rules on the nullish operators for +3 files, and
  each one's boundary had to be probed because reasoning gives the wrong
  answer. TS2869 ("right operand of `??` is unreachable") is purely
  SYNTACTIC in tsc: `false ?? true` and `{} ?? y` report while
  `const m = false; m ?? true` and `declare const s: string; s ?? "b"`
  are ACCEPTED — neither can be nullish either — so a type-level version
  would have reported two shapes tsc allows. `null` / `undefined` get a
  different code (TS2871) and `void 0` is a declared MISS, because tsc
  reports TS2869 there while the right operand really IS reached and
  following it would encode a compiler quirk. TS18048 / TS18049 is the
  other side of the same operator: the right operand runs only when the
  left is nullish, so inside it the left BINDING is narrowed to its
  nullish part and a member access on it is always an error
  (`f ?? f.toFixed()`). That rule matches the right operand's SHAPE
  instead of walking it, and the reason is soundness rather than
  economy — an assignment anywhere inside the RHS makes the binding
  non-nullish again (`s ?? ((s = "x"), s.length)` is ACCEPTED,
  measured), and a walk that missed an assignment form would fail OPEN
  into a false positive, while an access that IS the whole right operand
  can hide nothing. TS2790 is the applied-in-some-places family again
  and the FOURTH wrapper-node fail-open miss: `delete o.b` was checked,
  `delete o?.b` arrives as `OptionalChain(PropAccess(…))` and the match
  saw the WRAPPER, and `delete o["b"]` — the same property reference
  spelled with brackets — had no arm at all.
  Its REJECTION is worth as much as the rules, because the blocker is
  mechanical and exact. TS7031 / TS7018 (a nullish literal where a type
  must be inferred, under `noImplicitAny` with `strictNullChecks` off) is
  one sound rule covering three codes, and `var [a, b]: any = [undefined,
  null]` is ACCEPTED by tsc while the unannotated form is TS7031 — yet
  `TsStmt::Let` / `Const` / `Var` carries a `TsType` in which an ABSENT
  annotation and an explicit `: any` are the same `Any`. The parser has
  that fact at parse time (`parse_param` records it in
  `written_any_params` off `had_annotation`), so the fix is a
  declaration-level version of that channel plus a `strict_null_checks`
  field on the Parser, which has `no_implicit_any` and not this one.
  Batch DS is TS2386 / TS2394 / TS2565 for +3 files, and its lesson is
  that all three read WRONG from their message text. TS2386 ("overload
  signatures must all be optional or required") is purely about the `?`,
  so it needs no type and lives in the parser — and it needed FOUR sites,
  because a runtime class body, an interface, an object type literal and
  `declare class` each have their own member parser; the applied-in-some-
  places family taken completely on the first pass instead of discovered
  a batch later. In a runtime class the IMPLEMENTATION participates as
  REQUIRED, which is what makes `m?(x); m?(s); m(v) { }` an error tsc
  reports on both signatures, and `declare class` was the site with
  nothing because its member parser DISCARDED the `?`
  (`let _ = self.match_(Question)`). Only METHOD signatures participate:
  two same-named PROPERTIES are a duplicate identifier (TS2300 / TS2717),
  a different error that already fires, so putting properties in would
  report one declaration twice.
  TS2394's parameter half is where batch DN's recorded blocker finally
  dissolved. `TsFunc.body` is not optional, so an overload SIGNATURE and
  an implementation are indistinguishable downstream — and
  `note_function_declaration` is already called at every site that pushes
  a function declaration, with exactly the `bodiless` fact, so a
  `<fn-impl:NAME>` marker turns "the last declaration is the
  implementation" from the guess `check_overload_void_return` had to make
  into a FACT. The rule went into that same function rather than beside
  it. The marker is pushed ONLY from the module / namespace body loop,
  because `grammar_misuses` is a flat scope-blind channel and a nested
  `function f() { }` would otherwise claim an implementation for a name
  that exists in another body — the same restriction is why TS2393 is
  filed rather than shipped. Probed cell by cell, since the message does
  not say which direction: an incompatible parameter TYPE is the error,
  an implementation with FEWER parameters is LEGAL, and `any` accepts
  everything.
  TS2565 is expando flow — `function d() { }` then `d.e = 12`, and
  reading a property assigned only in a conditional branch — and its
  design decision is where the value is. One ordered pass per statement
  list tracks DEFINITE / POSSIBLE per `HOLDER.PROP`, and the `if`
  statement is the ONLY construct that can produce POSSIBLE: a write in
  anything the pass does not model counts as DEFINITE, so an unmodelled
  shape silences the check instead of firing on it. That is exactly what
  `switch (1) { default: d.q = 1 }` needs, since the default arm always
  runs and tsc accepts the read after it, so any reachability-aware
  formulation would have false-positived there. The price is the `while`
  case, which tsc does report, and that MISS is what buys FP 0. Three
  facts had to be probed rather than reasoned: `d["q"] = 1` and
  `d.q = 1` are NOT one rule (inside an `if` arm the bracket spelling
  makes the later `d.q` LEGAL and the dotted one does not, so the two
  spellings are collected separately); passing the holder to a function
  does not assign the property, and neither does `Object.assign`, so the
  report still stands; and a read from ANOTHER scope is legal however the
  property was assigned, which is why the READ walk stops at a nested
  function body and at a nested block while the WRITE walk descends into
  both. Two parser facts cost the first two drafts, and both are this
  file's recurring shape: `d.q = 1` at the top of a list is a
  `PropAssign` STATEMENT while the identical line inside a block is
  `Expr(PropAssignExpr(...))`, and reading only the first found NOTHING
  AT ALL; and a top-level `function d() { }` is parsed by the module loop
  into `module_.funcs` and is NOT pushed into `top_level_stmts`, so the
  outermost list has to be told about those holders by name.
  Batch DT is +2 files for two rules, and its reusable finding is about
  a KIND of lead rather than about either rule: both were the
  applied-in-some-places family, and at the missing site each carried a
  comment declining the rule with a stated reason that turned out to be
  FALSE. A recorded abstention is a lead — and its REASON still has to be
  probed. TS7010 ("lacks return-type annotation, implicitly has an `any`
  return type") existed for a bodiless `function` declaration and for
  `declare function` and for nothing else, so an interface method, an
  object-type method, a class overload signature, an `abstract` member
  and a `declare class` member were all silent; the class site's comment
  said "tsc does not flag an overload signature whose implementation
  carries the return annotation", and probing gives the inverse —
  `m(); m(x: number); m(x?: number): void { }` reports on BOTH
  signatures while annotated signatures with an unannotated
  implementation are ACCEPTED, because the exemption belongs to the BODY
  and not to the overload set. TS7022 / TS2448 (a binding whose own
  initializer evaluates a reference to it) existed for a `for…of` head
  and was missing at the DECLARATION site, so `let x = x` and
  `const x = [x]` were silent; the head rule's two-arm walk was
  justified by "a name reached through a call or a property is not the
  iterable itself, so widening this would claim a cycle that is not
  one", and the real line is not call-versus-property but whether the
  reference is EVALUATED before the binding initializes —
  `for (let v of [v])`, `[1, v]`, `g(v)` and `[...xs, v]` all report,
  `o.v` does not (a property name is a `String` in this AST and can
  never be reached as a `Var`), and `[() => v]` does not. Two codes, one
  condition, each gated on the fact it needs: TS2448 applies to
  `let`/`const` whatever the annotation says, since a TDZ is about time,
  while TS7022 needs the annotation ABSENT and is all a `var` gets.
  Threading the annotation fact in from the parse site also closed a
  pre-existing false positive the head rule's own comment had promised
  not to have — it gated on `var_type is Any`, which cannot tell an
  absent annotation from an explicit `: any` (the same blocker recorded
  for TS7031), so `for (var v: any of v)` was reported; and that
  spelling is not "legal" either, it is TS2483 + TS2502, two codes this
  rule does not claim, so the old behaviour was the right file for the
  wrong reason. Three pre-existing tests asserted the TS7010 gap BY
  NAME — the eighth, ninth and tenth in this repo found doing that —
  because `parse_module_or_empty` defaults `noImplicitAny` to true and
  all three wrote `class C { foo(x: number); foo(x: any) {} }` while
  asserting 0, so each was measuring the implicit-any hole rather than
  the overload rule it is named for.
  The batch also corrects the triage twice, both times the
  label-for-objective substitution: TS7023 and TS7053 were filed as
  "cheap and mechanical" implicit-any work and are neither. TS7023's
  three files all need an inference CYCLE detector through a class
  method's un-annotated return type, and the only cheap version keys on
  the exact corpus shape; TS7053's two need union-of-index-signature
  member resolution and assignment-target widening of
  `(options || {}).a`, which is why both files also carry TS2339 /
  TS2322. Five files moved to Tier 3.
  Batch DU is +1 and is the THIRD batch in a row whose target was a
  recorded abstention and the third whose stated reason was false, which
  promotes the move to a rule: open the comment that declines a rule,
  then probe its reason. `check_class_property_init_order` restricted
  TS2729's candidate set to init-bearing fields, saying a field declared
  without an initializer "has no initialization to be used before". It
  has — `class C { b; d = this.b }` and `class C { b: number; d = this.b
  }` are both TS2729 in EITHER declaration order, because a slot only
  written in the constructor is still `undefined` while field
  initializers run, so such a field never enters the `inited` set and
  order does not matter for it. The real exemption is a MODIFIER, and
  probing one cell at a time gives exactly two, `!` and `?`. It is
  emphatically not "the declared type admits undefined":
  `b: number | undefined`, `b: any`, `b: unknown` and `b: void` all
  report, and so does the whole thing under `strictNullChecks: false`, so
  a rule written from the type would have been wrong in four places. And
  since the parser wraps `x?: T` into exactly `T | undefined`, the `?`
  CANNOT be read off the type — it rides an `<optional-member:` sentinel
  recorded before the wrap, the same shape as `<quoted-member:`, which
  exists because TS2564 needed a fact the type could not carry either.
  `scopeResolutionIdentifiers`, the false positive the old abstention was
  protecting against, is the `s!: Date; n = this.s;` form, so it was
  avoided for the wrong reason and is still avoided for the right one.
  One declared MISS at the site: `declare b: T` is TS2729 in tsc, and the
  parser folds `has_declare` into `has_definite_assertion` — correctly,
  for TS2564 — so an ambient field reads as asserted here.
  Batch DV is +3 and is the batch that OVERTURNS one of these
  abstentions rather than an old one: batch DT had declined exactly these
  three files, saying "the only cheap version would key on the exact
  corpus shape", and the thing that settles it had been in the corpus the
  whole time. `for-of25` and `for-of26` are `for-of33` and `for-of34`
  with the returned name changed from the loop variable `v` to an
  unrelated `var x: any`, and both are TS7-ACCEPTED — so the
  discriminator is the NAME, which is the actual semantic distinction and
  not a match on file contents, and the corpus supplies twelve negative
  controls for free. Fourth time in this series that a stated
  abstention's reason turned out weaker than claimed, and the first where
  the abstention was written one batch earlier by the same pass. The rule
  is TS7022's INDIRECT form: a `for (var v of new C)` head takes its
  element type from C's iteration protocol, so an un-annotated `next()` /
  `[Symbol.iterator]()` that RETURNS `v` is a genuine inference cycle.
  It lives entirely in the PARSER, which is what keeps it small — the
  class body records the bare `Var` names its un-annotated protocol
  methods return, keyed by class name, and
  `record_for_head_binding_misuses`, where the DIRECT form already lives,
  joins against `new C`; the mention test is `collect_iterable_var_names`,
  the same walk, because "does this expression evaluate a reference to
  NAME" is the same question and a second walk would be the
  applied-in-some-places family in its purest form.
  Three gates keep it off legal code and all three were probed. Only the
  two PROTOCOL methods count — a `helper()` returning the loop variable
  is ACCEPTED, since nothing consults its return type. An annotated
  return breaks the cycle, so the rule needs `had_return_annotation`
  rather than `return_type is Any`, the same absent-versus-`: any`
  blocker recorded for TS7031 and TS2729. And a name the method itself
  BINDS is its own local: `next() { let v = { value: 1, done: false };
  return v }` beside `for (var v of new C)` is TS7-ACCEPTED, so firing
  there would be a false positive on legal code that NO corpus file
  covers — the bound-name set is over-approximated on purpose, losing
  findings rather than inventing them.
  The other half of the indirect form is NOT covered and is Tier 3, and
  probing is what drew the line: the reportable class is generic
  return-type inference from a CALLBACK, since `let x = arr.map(v => x)`
  reports while `let x = g(() => x)` with `g` declaring its return type
  is ACCEPTED, as are `let x = function () { return x }`, `[() => x]`
  and `{ m: () => x }`.
- `src/transform` is the JS-side pipeline behind `mtsc`: bundling, folding,
  tree-shaking, and the property mangler. Its safety story is type-driven and
  has two halves — `export_surface.mbt` (names reachable from the entry's
  exports) and `mangle_safety.mbt` + `flow_analysis.mbt` (names that reach a
  side-effect sink). The sink half is fail-closed: `callee_provenance.mbt`
  treats a call whose callee it can't prove bundle-internal as a hand-off
  across the boundary, and `pure_builtins.mbt` is the allowlist that keeps
  ordinary built-in calls from poisoning everything that flows through them.
  Both halves feed the reserved set that gates
  `--mangle-properties` and the dead-property pass. The DCE side has its
  own proof obligation instead: `purity.mbt` decides which internal
  functions and host statics are effect-free, and `treeshake.mbt`
  deletes a call only once that proof clears it. Every pass and what it
  has to prove is catalogued in
  [`docs/minify-patterns.md`](./docs/minify-patterns.md); see also
  [`docs/mangle-safety.md`](./docs/mangle-safety.md) and the
  `fixtures/mangle-safety` corpus (`just verify-mangle-safety`), which
  compiles each case with and without mangling, runs both bundles under Node,
  and treats any observable difference as a safety violation. Every case
  has an independent oracle — the original TypeScript run by Node — with
  exactly one declared exception (`case09b-decorator`, where transform
  mode cannot compile a TypeScript-legacy decorator, and which says so).
  Three cases had silently lost theirs and the harness had been printing
  "reference run unavailable" on every run: a value-form import of a type
  (`import { T }`, which TypeScript accepts and transform mode does not),
  the legacy `module X {}` keyword, and that decorator. Each was one
  fixture line, and each left its case comparing mtsc against mtsc, which
  is consistency and not correctness — the exact failure mode that let
  five scope-narrowing bugs survive thousands of fuzz seeds, sitting
  inside the corpus everything else leans on. The two compilation
  questions moved to unit tests, where they belong. A corpus only
  covers situations somebody thought of, so `just verify-real-world`
  minifies real published packages (React, the TypeScript compiler) and
  diffs their behaviour — see [`docs/real-world-minify.md`](./docs/real-world-minify.md).
  That runs each target under the one shipping flag set, which says
  *whether* the pipeline is broken but not *which pass*, so
  `just verify-pass-lattice` runs all sixteen combinations of
  `{treeshake, fold, minify, mangle}` over the 9 MB compiler: a
  combination that fails while each of its parts passes is an
  interaction between them, and that is how the single-use inliner's
  conditional-move bug was located. None of that reaches the case nobody
  imagined, so `just fuzz-mangle`
  generates programs from seeds, compiles each with and without mangling,
  and compares what they observed; a failing program is shrunk to its
  minimum automatically rather than reported as a seed number — see
  [`docs/mangle-fuzzing.md`](./docs/mangle-fuzzing.md). That comparison
  is a self-comparison, and for a long time it was the whole oracle:
  two mtsc outputs agreeing is consistency, not correctness, so a pass
  wrong BEFORE mangling is wrong identically in both legs and every
  seed reports "equivalent". That is not a hypothetical — it is how the
  five scope-narrowing bugs below survived thousands of seeds and were
  found by reading source instead. The original program, run by Node,
  is now the oracle for every generated program rather than only for
  the ones where the two legs already disagreed, and the generator
  emits the shapes those passes key on (`const enum`, a type guard, a
  literal-union dispatcher, an `as const` table) each read once
  normally and once through a scope that re-binds its name. Reverting
  either fix reproduces the bug as a two-node artifact. Node's default
  strip-only type stripping refuses `enum`, which made the reference
  leg silently unavailable on exactly the shape that is wrong with no
  optimization flag — `--experimental-transform-types` is what the leg
  needs, in this harness and in the corpus one. Transform mode brings a
  hole of its own, whose diagnostic points nowhere near the cause: Node
  22.22's SWC drops the parens around a comma expression whose first
  operand is an object literal, so
  `(({ ...obj, g: 1 } ? 1 : 2), (a--))` re-prints with `{` at statement
  start, the block that opens swallows the `...obj` as a rest
  parameter, and 23 of 6019 seeds lost their oracle to "Rest parameter
  must be last formal parameter" on a program that is valid as written
  and that mtsc compiles correctly. A leading `0,` does not rescue it —
  SWC drops a constant first operand of a discarded comma too — but
  `void` does, being an operator rather than a discardable operand.
  Its first 400 seeds
  with the new oracle found two bugs nothing else had: `as_const_inline`
  descended into a `delete` operand and read `obj['q']` there as a safe
  keyed read, so `delete obj['q']` compiled to `delete 1` and every
  later read folded to the stale value; and seven fold sites treated
  `is_js_truthy` / `is_js_falsy` as a licence to DISCARD the condition,
  which it is not for an object or array literal (truthy whatever is
  inside it, and the inside still runs) or for `void EXPR` (falsy
  whatever `EXPR` is). A program covering all seven lost seven of its
  eight calls under `--bundle --fold`. The one that survived was the
  `if` statement — which already had the guard, and a comment crediting
  the fuzzer's effect trace for it. Seventh time in this pipeline that
  one rule was written in several places and fixed in one. mtsc's own
  checker rejects a literal in condition, logical-operand and unary
  position, so that class is reachable only with checking off — the
  published-`.js` path — and lives in `fold_wbtest.mbt` rather than the
  corpus, which type-checks its sources. Sites eight and nine of the
  same rule turned up later, both spelled `return void EXPR` — one in
  `fold.mbt`, one in `peephole.mbt` — where a recursive
  `return void f0(a, z)` lost its recursion, the call-budget counter
  never ran down, and every call returned `undefined` where the source
  eventually returned `0`. And the pattern is not confined to that one
  rule: `x += 1` -> `x++` was written out at four sites in `peep_expr`,
  and every one was the wrong operator — `x += 1` evaluates to the NEW
  value, `x++` to the old, so `(arr[0] += 1) ? a : b` with `arr[0]` at 0
  took the wrong branch. `++x` is the same three bytes, so nothing was
  ever traded for it. A later 1200-seed export-shape campaign found the
  same coercion-vs-purity family once more, in the UNARY operators, and
  this time a TEST was pinning the bug in place. `-(-x)` -> `x` and
  `~(~x)` -> `x` were both gated on `is_pure_value`, which says nothing
  about the ToNumeric each operator applies: `-(-"alpha")` is `NaN` and
  the rewrite handed back `"alpha"`, `~~1.5` is `1`, `~~"alpha"` is `0`.
  `fold_wbtest.mbt` asserted that `~~n` folds to `n` for an unannotated
  `n` — directly below the `x | -1` test that gets the same question
  right, because the earlier bitwise round fixed the BINARY operators and
  stopped at the unary ones. A third rule in the cluster,
  `-(a - b)` -> `b - a`, was DELETED rather than gated: the two differ at
  zero (`-(1 - 1)` is `-0`), nothing there can prove `a - b != 0`, and
  the same file explains why `-0` matters twenty lines above, for
  `(Neg, IntLit(n))`. The sign of zero needs checking at every arithmetic
  rewrite, not once. The rule-equivalence harness had no case for any of
  the four unary forms — including the one that is CORRECT, `!!x` in a
  condition, which has a case now so nobody "fixes" it — and its domain
  held no non-integer at all, so any rule that TRUNCATES rather than
  preserves could pass on integers alone; `1.5` and `-1.5` are in it now.
  All three hunt
  code we delete and should not; `just verify-dce-coverage` hunts the
  opposite — code we keep and could drop — as a table of small programs
  that each assert a marker is gone, the live markers survive, and stdout
  still matches Node running the original. Orthogonal to all of them,
  `just verify-rule-equivalence` asks the narrow question about each
  rewrite on its own: every peephole/fold rule becomes a function body
  with holes, evaluated across a cross product of counterexample values
  (`undefined`, `-0`, `NaN`, a Symbol, a BigInt, an object with a
  poisoned `valueOf`, an array-like with a negative `length`) and
  compared against Node running the source directly. It found nine
  rewrites that assumed a type and checked nothing, and later six more:
  the harness covers the rules somebody wrote a case for and reports
  nothing about the rules that have none, so `Array.from(x)` -> `[...x]`
  shipped for months three lines below a comment explaining why the same
  rewrite on `Array.prototype.slice.call` had been removed. Every rewrite
  whose validity depends on the receiver's type now has a case; the
  built-in-method family is the whole of that subset, and gating it cost
  ~700 bytes across four corpus targets. A third round found the same
  shape once more, in the array-literal folds: a `Spread` element was
  counted as one position, so `[...array].reverse()` — a one-element
  literal, and reversing one element is a no-op — compiled to
  `[...array]` and remeda's `reverse` became a shallow copy. Each of
  those folds already had an `is_pure_value` guard that could not help,
  because a spread of a variable is perfectly pure; position was the
  question, not purity. The `.length` fold had been given a spread guard
  by the fuzzer and the lesson stopped at that one call site. A fourth
  round found the family with NO case at all: not one bitwise rule was
  covered, and six of them were wrong. `x & -1` -> `x` reasoned that
  AND with all-bits-set is the identity — true of the AND, but the
  operator also COERCES and the rewrite hands back the uncoerced
  operand, so `"alpha" & -1` is `0` and compiled to `"alpha"`. The
  fuzzer found it through `switch ("alpha" & -1)`, which selects
  `case 0` and ran the `default` instead. Same shape in `x | x` -> `x`,
  `x - x` -> `0`, `x ^ x` -> `0`, `x & 0` -> `0`, `x | -1` -> `-1` and
  `x ** 0` -> `1` (the last four swallow a BigInt/Symbol TypeError
  rather than a value). And `is_number_valued` — the numeric gate the
  `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul`/`Div` identities ALREADY had — delegated to
  `cmp_kind`, which calls a BigInt literal `CmpNum`: right for
  relational comparison, the one place the spec lets BigInt and Number
  mix, and backwards for arithmetic, where `5n - 0` throws. One
  definition fixed, not seven call sites. The four self-operand rules
  were deleted rather than gated: once the gate is right a bare `Var`
  can never satisfy it and nothing that can is a bare `Var`, so the
  pattern would be dead code that reads like live code. A fifth round
  found the domain itself incomplete: it had carried an object with a
  poisoned `valueOf` — the COERCION hazard — from the start, and never a
  getter, the READ hazard. `is_pure_value(PropAccess(recv, _))` was
  `is_pure_value(recv)`: pure whenever the RECEIVER was, which is a
  statement about evaluating `recv` and not about reading a property off
  it. Four rules therefore dropped a getter's body under
  `--bundle --treeshake --fold` — a bare `h.p;`, `void h.p;`, the left of
  a discarded comma, and the array-literal `.length` fold — so a getter
  that counts, memoizes, logs or lazily initializes stopped running.
  The sound answer costs +845 bytes on TypeScript's 3.5 MB output
  (0.02%), 255 FEWER on checker.ts, and nothing on hono, valibot or the
  terser corpus, which is far too little to justify a type-driven "this
  receiver's declared shape has no accessor" exception. Two lessons
  about the harnesses came with it. First, a case has to land the
  assertion in the COMPARED VALUE: two of the four new cases returned
  `[n, a.hits]` and passed while the optimized body visibly read
  `[2, a.hits]` instead of running the getter — coverage-shaped and
  proving nothing until they returned a scalar. Second, the fuzzer had
  emitted getters for months and could not reach the bug, because it
  spelled the read as `new C().g` (whose receiver is impure, so the read
  never was) and never in a value-discarded position; binding an
  instance to a `const` and emitting the discarded position directly
  took it from 0 findings in 600 comparisons to 21 in 209. See
  [`docs/rule-equivalence.md`](./docs/rule-equivalence.md). And
  `just compare-terser` asks the
  competitive version of that question: both optimizers start from the
  same unoptimized JS, and a LOSS names a terser compress rule we have
  not ported, while a LOSS *or a tie* on a `type-aware` case means the
  type-driven pass did not fire — see
  [`docs/terser-parity.md`](./docs/terser-parity.md). It stands at
  32 win / 0 loss, and getting there is a caution about reading a
  harness's own labels: of the seven rules it named, only one was
  missing as named. The last loss was labelled `computed_props`, and
  that rule was ported and firing — the real two bytes were the
  mangler renaming an exported `o` to `a`, the same length, saving
  nothing and paying five for `export{a as o}`. Renaming an
  export-clause name costs `len(new) + 4` and saves
  `(len(orig) - len(new))` per site, and only the single-character case
  needs no cost model: the saving is exactly zero, so it loses for any
  reference count and any name the mangler picks. That case is ported
  (zod -78 bytes, everything else byte-identical). The GENERAL rule was
  implemented, measured, and dropped: the optimistic bound
  `(len - 1) * sites < 5` gave -54/-40/-63/-231/-36/-3 on six targets
  against +291 on remeda and +267 on typebox, a net loss of about 168
  bytes. Reserving a name also withholds it from the generated pool, so
  the most-used identifier can lose its one-character slot, and that
  dominates the alias it saves — the arithmetic is a bound, not a
  model. `typeofs` was already implemented and simply
  never ran, because peephole is what BUILDS `void 0 === void 0` and
  the fold that collapses it sits in `fold-2`, one phase earlier.
  `negate_iife` was not about negation at all but about splicing a
  side-effect wrapper's body out. `loops` was `sequences`, where the
  comma is free and the two braces it lets you drop are the entire
  win. And 3 of `if_return`'s 11 bytes were a regression of our own:
  a method shorthand is stored as `("p", FuncExpr { name: "p" })`, so
  the mangler's "drop the name of any function expression that does
  not reference itself" turned `p(){…}` into `p:()=>{…}` on every
  object literal with a method. Restoring the name unconditionally
  then cost 7 bytes elsewhere, because a single-`return` body really
  is shorter as `p:a=>a` — the rule has to compare the two spellings,
  not prefer one.
  Every harness above asks whether a pass is *correct*; `just
  measure-type-aware` asks whether the type-driven half is *worth
  anything*. It cannot use published `.js`: the six type-reading phases
  (`predicate-inline`, `switch-fold`, `as-const-inline`, `tag-rewrite`,
  `class-method-dce`, `type-fold`) fill their tables from parsed
  TypeScript, so on erased JS the answer is zero by construction. So each
  target is a package cloned from git and optimized twice with identical
  flags — once from the TypeScript source, once from the same code with
  its types erased — with all three legs required to observe the same
  thing. The answer so far is uncomfortable and worth knowing: across
  NINE measured targets — every one behaviour-checked, no `size-only` and
  no `BLOCKED` rows left — there is **one win**: typebox at +247 bytes
  (0.21%), seven neutral, and one loss inside a byte of the noise floor
  (-0.11% on Excalidraw). zod was the tenth and is out: its bundle makes
  eight `Reflect.ownKeys` calls plus four `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(s)`
  ones, which enumerate NON-enumerable properties — exactly what a class
  prototype method is — so class-method DCE is suppressed there by
  construction and no amount of type information changes the answer. Be
  precise about what that costs, because it is easy to overstate: zod's
  own report also says "nothing would have been dropped anyway", so the
  reflection is not what made zod NEUTRAL. It was a permanent zero for a
  permanent reason at the price of the corpus's slowest run, and the four
  bugs it found are covered elsewhere (`verify-graph-walk` for the module
  walk; fixtures for the erased-`as` arrow parens, the type-only
  namespace entries and the merged interface-and-function case). Both of the numbers that moved came from
  attributing them per pass rather than arguing about them:
  `--disable-phase` prices each type-reading phase on its own, and it
  said `predicate-inline` was costing typebox 261 bytes — which was
  typebox's entire LOSS. The pass's `removable` flag asked "is this name
  in the entry's export list?" and called that "can the declaration be
  deleted?"; typebox's guards leave through a linker-synthesized
  namespace object, so every one of them read as removable, every body
  got copied, and not one declaration was deleted (836 functions before,
  836 after). Counting non-call references instead — a call is the only
  mention inlining rewrites, so the declaration dies only when calls are
  the only mentions — took the phase to 0 and flipped typebox to the
  corpus's first WIN, while leaving the two targets the pass does pay off
  on (superstruct +29, remeda +26) untouched. Four of the six
  type-reading phases moved zero bytes on all ten targets, and "zero"
  is two different findings wearing one number — the shape is absent
  (nothing to fix) or the shape is there and a gate refused it (the
  reason names the fix). The byte count cannot tell them apart, so
  `tag-rewrite` now says which: `--explain-mangle` reports the alias
  count, the multi-variant-union count, and the SHAPE of each rejected
  variant. The first answer was "gate too closed", and by a wide
  margin: `object_string_literal_fields` returned `None` for anything
  but an inline `Object(fields)`, so `type Shape = Circle | Square` —
  how real code declares a union — was rejected before any safety gate
  ran, and every union in all ten targets died there (typebox: 51
  named-reference variants, immer: 19, ts-pattern: 9). Resolving a
  named reference through the interface table, `extends` included,
  produces candidates at last: typebox `keyword` (31 tags) and
  `~kind`, zod `code` and `type`, excalidraw `type` and `status`,
  ts-pattern `type`. Generic arguments need no substitution — a
  discriminant is always `Literal(_)` and a type parameter is
  `Named(T)`, so `Circle<Meters>` and `Circle<Feet>` agree on
  `kind: "circle"` for free. The bytes are still zero on all ten, and
  that is now a fact about those libraries rather than about the pass:
  typebox's `keyword` reaches a sink and its `~kind` leaves through
  `TDeferred`'s exported signature. Opening the gate first meant
  fixing what opening it would have spread. `tag_rewrite` did not look
  at exports AT ALL — `grep export tag_rewrite.mbt` was empty — and it
  rewrites a property's VALUE, so `export const c: Shape = { kind:
  "circle" }` compiled to `{ kind: 0 }` under plain
  `mtsc --bundle --fold` and a consumer's `c.kind === "circle"` was
  false, demonstrated with a separate consumer module. The bundle's own
  escape-sink scan cannot see that; the comparison is outside it. The
  mirrored direction is as real: with only
  `export function area(s: Shape)` crossing, the CONSUMER builds
  `{ kind: "circle" }` and the bundle compares it against `0`. Gating
  on `exported_surface_props` was tried and was wrong — that set
  answers the mangler's "may this NAME be renamed", follows a called
  function's body, and reserves `kind` for
  `export const out = area(shapes[0])` where the consumer only ever
  sees a number; it broke a legitimate test, which was the correct
  signal. A value rewrite needs the narrow fact: an exported
  declaration's own value (a function's RETURNS, not the closure —
  `expr_mentions_k` taints every closure, so passing the initializer
  kills the pass for any bundle exporting a function) plus the type
  names in its signature, which is the only way to see the direction
  where the consumer constructs the value. Third time this exact split
  was needed, after `class_method_dce` against
  `collect_externally_visible_props`. Both facts arrive as one
  REQUIRED positional `TagRewriteBoundary?`, the way
  `class_method_dce_block` takes its `off_bundle`: a labelled default
  would fail open here, since an empty `externals` means fewer SINKS
  rather than fewer candidates.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case49-tag-rewrite-export-boundary` runs both
  directions under Node, and its first draft had ZERO detection power:
  it observed `unitCircle.kind === "circle"` computed inside the
  bundle, and a comparison rewritten alongside its literal stays true,
  while a plain `.kind` read elsewhere closed the prop-uses gate so the
  pass declined for an unrelated reason. Every observation is an
  exported OBJECT now, and with the gate mutated off the case reports
  `{"kind":0,"r":1}` against the baseline's `{"kind":"circle","r":1}`.
  The other three inert phases got the same treatment, and the answer
  was different for each — which is the argument for asking per pass
  rather than reasoning about "the type-driven half". `switch-fold` is
  SHAPE ABSENT: seven of the nine targets contain not one function whose
  first parameter is a closed string-literal union, and the three
  candidates in the other two are false positives of that entry test —
  the report names them now, because a count never says what to look at.
  typebox's `LiteralBooleanMapping` / `WithBooleanMapping` have no
  `switch` at all (`return T.Literal(Guard.IsEqual(input, 'true'))`) and
  both call sites pass `_0 as 'true' | 'false'`, a runtime value, so
  widening the BODY gate cannot help: the call-site gate needs a
  `StringLit`. excalidraw's is a class `constructor`, which no widening
  can replace with an arm expression. Deleting the pass is equally wrong
  — it is the only thing that wins the terser-parity
  `switch-literal-union` case, a `type-aware` case where a TIE already
  counts as a failure — and its one historical bug, the name-keyed table
  taking the outer dispatcher's arm for a call to a shadowing parameter,
  is covered under Node by `case43-table-shadowing`. So: kept unchanged,
  with the measured reach and both reasons written into its header, so
  the question is not re-litigated. `type-fold` is the
  opposite and the more interesting one — 578 candidate sites across
  the corpus (zod 181, excalidraw 163, remeda 128) and ZERO decided.
  That is not a lookup failing; it is a TAUTOLOGY. A programmer writes
  `typeof x === "string"` or `x === null` exactly when the annotation
  does not settle it: zod's sites are `typeof val === "string"` on
  `unknown`, excalidraw's are `insertionIndex === null` on
  `number | null`, remeda's are `param === undefined` on
  `T | undefined`. Flow-sensitive narrowing would not help, because
  the check IS the narrowing. The report breaks the total down by
  shape for exactly this reason: "0 of 578" is only actionable once
  you can see that 320 of them are `typeof` on a union.
  `class-method-dce` already had a report, and it said the same thing
  on all ten targets — SUPPRESSED by a computed member read that is
  "neither provably numeric nor an entry of a keyed container",
  `points[i]` / `elements[index]` / `value[index]`. Probing the
  spellings one at a time found exactly ONE that fails, and it is the
  commonest array idiom in JavaScript: a CALLBACK parameter carries no
  annotation, so `arr.map((v, index) => arr[index])` leaves `index`
  unprovable, and since the suppression is a bundle-wide wildcard, one
  such read keeps every method of every class. A `for` counter, a
  `while` counter, a `for…of` binding, a parameter annotated `number`
  and a `readonly number[]` receiver are all already proven. The fix
  needs the receiver proven to be an array before it can claim the
  second parameter is an index — `Map.prototype.forEach` is
  `(value, key, map)`, `Set`'s is `(value, value, set)`, and an
  imported receiver could be either — and a false "numeric" claim
  breaks property-mangle correctness.
  That diagnosis was WRONG, and the way it was wrong is the lesson:
  the failing shape and the failing PROOF were different things. What
  actually fails in `arr.map((v, i) => arr[i])` is the RECEIVER, not
  the index — `numeric_vars` and `container_vars` both skip any
  binding marked `captured_by_closure`, so the arrow's mere mention of
  `arr` kept it from being proven a keyed container, and either proof
  alone would have opened the gate. The guard's stated premise is a
  WRITE from a frame the pass does not follow, and no frame may write
  a `const`: modules are strict, so an assignment throws rather than
  landing a non-numeric value, and the values the binding can hold are
  exactly its defs, which the walk already checks. Exempting `const`
  clears every spelling; the `for`/`while`/`for…of`/annotated-parameter
  spellings had always worked because they were never captured, and
  the shape of the index was never the variable.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case50-const-captured-by-callback` pins it
  under Node, and putting `area` in its `expectKeep` failed the
  corpus's own mutation self-check — correctly: a method called only
  from inside the bundle may be renamed, so "it still runs" is the
  behavioural comparison's job, not `expectKeep`'s.
  It still buys ZERO bytes on all ten targets, and a census in the
  report says why in numbers — `(bindings of this name that are
  provably numeric / all bindings of it)`. Three kinds of blocker:
  `key`-style string keys correctly refused (excalidraw 0 of 34,
  typebox 0 of 53); `i`-style numeric keys defeated by
  `numeric_name_set`'s NAME-level all-or-nothing projection
  (excalidraw's `i` is 64 of 90, so 26 unprovable bindings disqualify
  every `arr[i]` in a 95-file bundle); and real reflection —
  `Reflect.ownKeys` x8 and `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors` x2 in
  zod, which can never be proven away. Adding `ObjectLit` to
  `is_expr_container` clears zod's top blocker
  (`TypeDictionary[issue.expected]`, 53 occurrences) and was
  implemented, measured and REVERTED: zero bytes, because the
  suppression is all-or-nothing and 53 of 80 blockers is the same as
  none, against a `__proto__` / `Object.setPrototypeOf` exposure not
  yet closed. The design problem looked like the bundle-wide wildcard
  itself — one `Reflect.ownKeys` anywhere keeps every method of every
  class — so the filed next step was per-receiver suppression, the same
  reasoning `class_members_reachable_off_bundle` applies at the bundle
  boundary. That is CLOSED now, and by measuring its ceiling before
  writing any of it, which took one command: the report's
  `unused class methods` section already says how many methods a
  suppression COST, and that is the exact upper bound on any narrowing.
  Eight of the ten targets never reach the suppression at all — the
  early exit added below says `nothing to do — every declared method is
  read somewhere static or is on the export surface` — so the sentence
  above, "it said the same thing on all ten targets", is no longer
  true. The whole corpus-wide ceiling is **14 methods**: excalidraw 5,
  hono 18 declarations of 9 distinct names, zero everywhere else. And
  hono's nine are not headroom, which is the finding that matters:
  `HonoRequest.param` / `parseBody` / `valid` / `queries` / `blob` /
  `bytes` / `matchedRoutes` / `routePath` / `addValidatedData` are the
  public API an application spells as `c.req.param("id")`. Reading them
  as unreachable was an export-surface HOLE, so opening the gate would
  have shipped the bug and the wildcard was the only thing stopping it.
  Four holes, all in one walk, each one enough to make
  `mtsc entry.ts --bundle` — no optimization flag — delete a method a
  consumer goes on to call. `index_prop_assigns`'s doc comment says it
  indexes `NAME.prop = value`, and that one spelling was all it
  indexed: a compound assignment through a property
  (`NAME.prop ??= v`, `||=`, `&&=`) had no arm, and that is how real
  code writes a lazily-created member — hono memoizes `#req`,
  `#matchResult` and `#path` exactly that way, and a consumer got
  `TypeError: c.req.param is not a function`. Nor did
  `NAME["prop"] = v`, which is the same write spelled differently. A
  key we cannot spell (`NAME[k] = v`) can reserve no name but its value
  still leaves inside the object, and goes under the `@@computed:`
  sentinel `is_opaque_object_key` already existed for. Third,
  `surface_lookup_member` resolved `bag.prop` against the object
  literal's own entry — `undefined` — and STOPPED, treating a necessary
  source as a sufficient one; `return bag` was always fine, because
  widening to the whole object routes through the `prop_assigns` loop,
  and that is what made the hole look like working code. Fourth,
  `surface_escape_class` put the value escape INSIDE the
  `is_internal_marker_prop` filter, so a `#private` field's value never
  escaped while the identical PUBLIC field's did — ninth time one rule
  was written in two places and applied in one, and the top-level
  `prop_assigns` loop sixty lines above had it right. None of the four
  is reachable by a self-comparison: the deletion happens in every mtsc
  leg, so two mtsc outputs agree, and `--verify` sees nothing because
  every name still resolves.
  Fixing the READ half then introduced a NON-TERMINATION, and the memo
  that stops it was already twenty lines away in the same file: a
  recorded write can read the key it writes, which is what an increment
  is, so `const ledger = { n: 0 }` with
  `ledger.n = ledger.n + 1` escaped the write, whose left operand is
  `ledger.n` again. Five lines, 10 ms with `= 1` and never with
  `= ledger.n + 1`; `case36-annotated-boundary` has exactly that
  increment and wedged the corpus, which was misread as CPU contention
  for twenty minutes until `ps` showed three mtsc processes on one
  fixture. `surface_should_walk`'s own doc comment describes this
  failure mode ("did not finish in seven minutes"), and the fix is to
  key it on `(receiver, key)` as well. One ordering matters: `resolved`
  is set from the entry scan BEFORE the memo can decline, or a second
  arrival falls through to the widening and the cycle becomes an
  over-reservation instead of a hang. Two unit tests, and the second is
  the point — a memo keyed on the KEY alone misses the mutual form
  (`a.toB = b; b.toA = a`), where neither write mentions its own key.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case60-property-write-spellings` exports each
  holder and calls the method only from `driver.mjs`, outside the
  bundle, so nothing in the bundle names it and the export surface is
  the only thing that can keep it; the comparison is against Node
  running the same TypeScript. Its first draft handed the inner object
  to an `--external` module instead and FAILED — correctly, and the
  reason is worth keeping: an external call routes through off-bundle
  reachability, a different analysis, which attributes the escaping
  value to the HOLDER and not to the class held inside it. The case
  reproduced the bug while proving nothing about the fix, because it
  never exercised the export surface at all. What the case cannot do is
  the other direction — a value comparison cannot observe an absence,
  since the reference leg has the method — and `verify-dce-coverage`
  plus the corpus byte deltas cover that. The cost of widening the
  analysis is ZERO bytes on all ten targets, byte-for-byte, and since a
  zero can also mean "the pass never fires on real code" the confirmation
  is a separate observation: hono's report went from `SUPPRESSED` plus
  `would have dropped 18 unreached method(s)` naming
  `HonoRequest.param` and eight siblings, to `nothing to do — every
  declared method is read somewhere static or is on the export surface`.
  Those nine public methods are on the surface now, which is direct
  evidence the walk follows hono's real `#req ??= new HonoRequest(…)`,
  and the corpus-wide #73 ceiling drops from 14 methods to 5
  (excalidraw alone). The bytes not moving is the same conclusion this
  document reaches from four other directions: the reserved set is not
  large, it is EXHAUSTIVE, so adding a reservation route changes
  nothing. `verify-dce-coverage` is unchanged at 31 eliminated /
  0 broken, which is the check that the widening did not over-reserve.
  What DOES ship from that investigation is a warning, because
  reflection is the one blocker the author rather than the compiler has to
  act on: `mtsc` now says so by default rather than behind
  `--explain-mangle`. It is deliberately narrow in three ways. It fires
  only for the reflection tier — an unprovable computed key is the
  compiler's problem to improve and blaming the author for it would be
  wrong. It fires only when the suppression actually COST a method:
  reflection in a bundle whose every method is reachable anyway lost
  nothing, and a warning naming a loss that did not happen is a warning
  people learn to ignore — zod is exactly that case, eight
  `Reflect.ownKeys` calls and "nothing would have been dropped anyway".
  And it is silent when the JS itself is going to stdout, where the line
  would land inside the program; `--warn-reflection` forces it on there,
  `--no-warn-reflection` off anywhere. `unreached_class_methods` is one
  function read by both the report and the warning, because a cost
  computed separately from the report is a cost that can disagree with
  it. The property
  mangler was reported inert on
  every library measured, and that turned out to be one bug rather than
  a limit: a `const f = (…) => …` had no entry in the graph's function
  table, so a call to one was treated as opaque and marked `External` —
  which IS the wildcard, so a single arrow suppressed property mangling
  for a whole bundle. Giving an arrow its declared name as an identity
  moves real bytes (hono -9.4%, neverthrow -2.6%) and removed one of the
  three LOSSes. It is still SUPPRESSED by the wildcard on six of the nine
  targets — typebox, immer, ts-pattern, superstruct, remeda, excalidraw,
  every large one — and the obvious next move was to narrow that
  wildcard: every reason reported on typebox came from ONE site
  (`External` observability with no closed type annotation), the
  reservation's blast radius is plainly too wide (an unknown-typed
  binding means the names on THAT binding are unknown, not that every
  name in the bundle is reachable), and each hazard it was covering has
  its own separate wildcard already. Implemented, measured on both
  binaries directly, and REVERTED: typebox 119,686 either way,
  excalidraw 279,800, remeda 28,533. Zero bytes, in exchange for
  loosening the riskiest pass in the repo. The premise was wrong and the
  evidence had been on screen the whole time — the reserved-set
  breakdown prints BELOW the `SUPPRESSED` notice, and a `grep -A 12` had
  been cutting it off. It reads: external 54, host-shaped 39, and
  **`reaches a side-effect sink` 340**. That last set already covers what
  the wildcard covered, which is why removing it changes nothing. Nor is
  `SUPPRESSED` the same as inert: `--mangle-properties` still saves 247
  bytes on typebox under the wildcard, because the notice means "no
  USER-DECLARED property name is renamed", and the dead-property pass and
  the discriminant renumbering are neither.
  The 340-name sink set was the next suspect, and it is not the blocker
  either. Every reserved name now carries the FACT that reserved it,
  grouped and ranked, and the section labelled "reaches a side-effect
  sink" turns out to name its smallest contributor: 293 of the 333 names
  are the keys of linker-synthesized namespace objects
  (`export * as ns from …` becomes `const ns = { exp1: resolved1, … }`).
  Those were identified by SHAPE — "a `const` initialized to an object
  literal of bare `Var`s" — which also matches every
  `const handlers = { onClick, onBlur }` and every dispatch table a
  library writes; the linker knows which bindings it created, so
  `LinkRenames` carries `synthesized_namespaces` now and the analysis
  uses the fact, with the guess kept only as the no-information fallback
  because it over-reserves. The guess was over-reaching by 7 names on
  typebox, not by 293 — much less than a first reading of the report
  suggested. And the ceiling settles it: with the pre-pass reserving
  NOTHING, typebox is 119,686, excalidraw 279,800, remeda 28,533,
  byte-for-byte identical, so the whole 293-name reservation costs zero
  because those names are reserved by another route anyway. Two plausible
  narrowings of the reserved side, implemented and measured, both zero:
  the reserved sets are not the constraint. What the mangler CONSIDERS is
  the other term of that subtraction, and counting it ends the line of
  work: a census in the report says how many distinct property names a
  bundle has and how many survive to be candidates, and the answer is
  ZERO candidates on typebox (0 of 418), excalidraw (0 of 909), valibot
  (0 of 147), immer (0 of 115), remeda (0 of 96), ts-pattern (0 of 83)
  and superstruct (0 of 54); neverthrow has one and hono six. The
  reserved set is not large, it is EXHAUSTIVE — which is exactly why
  narrowing any single route measures zero, since a name reserved by six
  routes needs all six removed. And the reservations are RIGHT: typebox's
  property names are the JSON-Schema wire format (`type`, `properties`,
  `items`, `$ref`, `allOf`, `pattern`), excalidraw's are the elements it
  serializes to `.excalidraw` files, remeda's belong to the caller's own
  data. Nothing there may be renamed, so the pass being inert is the
  correct answer and not a defect.
  Which leaves hono's -2107 bytes (-9.4%), the number that justified
  putting `--mangle-properties` into the measured flag set. Its six
  candidates are ALL `__private_brand__0__*` — mtsc's own synthesized
  private-field brands, about 24 characters each, 77 occurrences,
  77 x ~27 = the whole delta. Not one USER-DECLARED property name has
  ever been renamed on any measured target; the pass's entire measured
  value is cleaning up after `private_fields.mbt`, which failed to lower
  hono's real `#path` / `#routes` / `#notFoundHandler` back to native
  private syntax. Emitting `#path` is shorter than any mangled name and
  correct by construction, so #79 is the actual fix and the -9.4%
  belongs in the lowering's column, not the mangler's.
  And that turned out to be a leak, not just an attribution error.
  `lower_private_fields` ran ONLY in the merged pipeline, which is gated
  on `--mangle`/`--treeshake`/`--fold`, so plain `mtsc entry.ts --bundle`
  emitted the brand verbatim — and a brand is an ordinary own ENUMERABLE
  property, so `class C { #secret = 7 }` printed
  `{"__private_brand__0__secret":7}` through `JSON.stringify` and showed
  up in `Object.keys`, object spread and `for…in`, where Node gives `{}`
  and `[]`. Adding any optimization flag fixed it, which is exactly why
  nothing noticed: every harness that exercises the per-module emit path
  exercises it WITH flags. Third time a pass has been missing from that
  path; `class_method_dce_block` was the first two. Two of the tests
  pinning the old output ASSERTED the leak — one required
  `__private_brand__` to be present and `#count` absent — because they
  were written against the shape plain `--bundle` happened to produce.
  The second half was the lowering's own guard, which required a brand to
  be mentioned by exactly one top-level statement. That also refuses TWO
  classes each declaring the same private name: the parser numbers brands
  per module, so hono's `Context.#path` and `Hono.#path` are both
  `__private_brand__0__path`, and after linking that brand appears in two
  statements — both of them class nodes that declare it. Each `#x` is
  scoped to its own class body, so renaming both is right, and the count
  refused; five of hono's six surviving brands were this rather than the
  accessor. The guard now asks the precise question — every statement
  mentioning the brand must be a class node that DECLARES it — which
  still refuses the real hazard, a computed-key accessor
  (`get [GET_MATCH_RESULT]()`) that the class lowering hoists out to
  `Object.defineProperty(C.prototype, KEY, { get() { … this.#x } })`.
  hono's `--mangle` bundle without property mangling went 22,317 ->
  21,177 bytes, five of six brands now native, and the leak closed in
  the configuration that had it. With `--mangle-properties` it goes the
  other way, 20,210 -> 20,817: the old smaller number was the mangler
  renaming 24-character brands to one character, and `#notFoundHandler`
  is 16 characters that the mangler declines to touch. Which is itself
  a missed opportunity rather than a cost — a `#private` name is
  class-scoped and cannot be anybody's ABI, so it is the one property
  class that needs no proof to rename — done, and it is worth
  -1,876 bytes on hono by itself (`--mangle-properties` there goes
  20,721 -> 18,845, and against plain `--mangle`'s 20,951 the pass is
  now -2,106, -10.1%). The old skip gave two reasons and only the second
  was real: there is "nothing to hide" (true, and beside the point —
  `#notFoundHandler` is 16 characters and `#a` is two), and renaming
  would "drop the `#`, turning a private field back into an ordinary
  visible property" (true of a bare mint, so the mint keeps the prefix).
  The candidate check runs BEFORE the reserved set, because that set
  answers "can something outside see this name" and for a `#` name the
  answer is no whatever the escape analysis concluded — six of the ten
  measured targets reserve the wildcard, so leaving privates behind the
  check would keep them un-mangled exactly where the pass is otherwise
  inert. Two classes each declaring `#path` both become `#a`, which is
  correct: they are different members, each resolving in its own class
  body. This is also the first crack in "candidate 0 on every library" —
  there is now one candidate class that needs no escape analysis at all.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case58-private-name-mangling` is a SAFETY case
  rather than an optimization pin: mutating the rename back off leaves it
  passing, correctly, since declining to rename breaks nothing, while
  dropping the `#` from the mint fails it on all four ways a private must
  stay invisible (`Object.keys`, `JSON.stringify`, spread, `for…in`).
  Writing it turned up two CHECKER holes, both unrelated and both filed
  rather than fixed: `#x in obj` — the ergonomic brand check, and the
  idiomatic class type guard — fails with `cannot find name
  __private_brand__0__path` because the `in` operand is lowered to the
  brand name the checker has no entry for; and `Array.prototype.sort()`
  with no comparator is rejected as `expected 1 argument(s), got 0`.
  Neither is reachable from the corpus because every fixture that would
  hit them was written around them, which is how they survived.
  `just verify-pass-lattice` is the harness that exists to find exactly
  this — a pass present in some flag combinations and not others — and it
  ran the guilty combination (bare `--bundle` is the first entry in its
  table) on every run and reported "15/15 behave identically". Two
  independent reasons, both worth knowing: its target is a PUBLISHED
  `.js` bundle, and `typescript.js` has no `#private` fields, no enums,
  no namespaces and no parameter properties, so NO TypeScript-only
  lowering is exercised by that harness at all; and even with such a
  field present, its only observation is whether `tsc`'s stdout matches,
  which an extra own enumerable property on an internal object never
  reaches. Its reference leg is genuinely independent — the baseline is
  the original `typescript.js` — so this is a coverage gap rather than a
  self-comparison, and the same lesson as the getter cases that passed
  while the bug was present: a harness that runs the right input and
  asks a question the answer cannot reach proves nothing. CLOSED by a
  second table: `fixtures/pass-lattice/lowerings.ts` runs the same
  fifteen combinations over one of every TypeScript-only lowering —
  `#private` fields instance and static, parameter properties,
  accessors, `enum`, `const enum`, nested `namespace`,
  abstract/override — and observes VALUES rather than stdout (own keys,
  `JSON.stringify`, object spread, `for…in`), with Node running the
  TypeScript directly as the baseline, so the reference is the language
  and not another mtsc output. Deliberately NOT a real library: the 9 MB
  target covers the shape nobody thought of, and what was missing was
  the lowerings plus a question the answer can reach — one cheap
  purpose-built compile covers every lowering where a library covers
  whichever ones it happens to use. Re-introducing the historical bug
  fails it and names the leaked brands (`counterJson: "{}" ->
  "{__private_brand__0__count:2,…}"`); the diff names the moved fields,
  because with fifteen combinations and twenty-five observations
  "differs" is not something anyone can act on.
  hono (+500 bytes) and zod (+788) *were* wins until the `TypeArgs` fix
  below, which is the point: `f<T>(x)` parses as a wrapper node, nineteen
  passes never peeled it, and the references inside were invisible to
  liveness — so the type-aware leg had been deleting code it should have
  kept, and the wrapper does not exist in erased JS, so the unsoundness
  was exclusive to the type-aware path. Excalidraw, the corpus's only UI
  application and only monorepo, is what found it, along with five holes
  that stopped it bundling at all (`.json` and `.scss` imports parsed as
  TypeScript, a `.woff2` decoded as UTF-8 because the asset check ran
  after the read, tsconfig `paths` not followed through `"extends"`, and
  `from "."` not recognised as relative) and one fixture that had been
  passing by accident — `case08-typeargs`, where an object literal handed
  to an identity function lost its nested keys because only callback
  arguments escaped through a call (`surface_escape_returned_args`).
  Chasing Excalidraw's remaining -1.7% then found the worst bug of the
  three, and it was in the plainest path there is: `mtsc entry.ts
  --bundle`, with no optimization flag at all, deleted every method of a
  class whose call sites are in another module. `class_method_dce_block`
  asks bundle-wide questions and the per-module emit path handed it one
  module, so "bundle" quietly became "this module"; it now takes a
  `scope` (analyse the graph, rewrite the module). That bundle was the
  corpus's *reference* leg, so the -1.7% was mostly a reference that had
  already lost 8 KB of methods — the real number is -0.11%. All three
  legs had agreed with each other the whole time, which is the lesson
  worth keeping: leg agreement is consistency, not correctness. It
  also found the
  reason four popular packages could not be measured at all, and it took
  four separate fixes to clear them: an unmemoized `export_surface.mbt`
  walk that re-escaped a class once per `new` site
  (`surface_should_walk`), a module-graph walk that deduplicated on the
  import SPECIFIER so `./x.js` -> `x.ts` was re-parsed on every visit —
  2^depth on a diamond graph, and why zod could not finish parsing 133
  files in eighteen minutes (`just verify-graph-walk` gates it now), an
  arrow body losing its parens through an erased `as`, and type-only
  exports landing in a synthesized namespace object. zod went from
  BLOCKED to a behaviour-checked win. It also found the one real
  behavioural difference so far — `--mangle` renaming a class whose
  `.name` the bundle reads back — and `observed_names.mbt` reserves just
  the observed names, narrowed by the class hierarchy because
  `this.constructor` in a method of `C` is `C` or a subclass: six of
  eight targets pay 25 bytes or less where reserving every callable cost
  up to +70%. See
  [`docs/type-aware-measurement.md`](./docs/type-aware-measurement.md).
  Every one of those rows compiles a library's PACKAGE entry, which is
  structurally unfair to two of the questions: a barrel's exports are
  all live, so tree-shaking has nothing to remove, and a library's
  object shapes ARE its wire format, so the mangler is right to reserve
  every name. `--app` compiles an APPLICATION that consumes each
  library instead, with the usage copied from that library's own README
  rather than chosen — an entry written by the person measuring is an
  entry written to make the passes fire. The answer is that the entry
  does not matter: tree-shaking moves enormously (remeda 28,533 ->
  3,402, valibot 86,982 -> 8,056, excalidraw 279,800 -> 121,114) and
  the six type-reading phases move 54 bytes across the whole corpus,
  975 -> 1,029. Two rows shift and both are small — typebox's
  `predicate-inline` 0 -> 288 (a package entry's guards all leave
  through a namespace object, so inlining never deletes the
  declaration) and excalidraw's `as-const-inline` 920 -> 715 (fewer
  sites in a 57%-smaller bundle, a higher rate). The property-name
  census settles the other half flatly: the candidate count is
  IDENTICAL on all nine targets, and excalidraw sheds 400 property
  names (909 -> 509) without gaining one candidate. Reading
  `--explain-mangle` says why — the reservations were never the export
  surface. ts-pattern's are its own `export * as P` namespace keys
  (x27), its untyped internal `pattern` / `value` / `key` bindings, and
  literal keys handed to sinks: library internals, which an
  application's entry cannot change. Same conclusion this document
  reaches from four other directions — the reserved set is not large,
  it is exhaustive, and it is right. What the exercise DID buy was a
  bug, in the plainest path there is: `mtsc app.ts --bundle` with no
  optimization flag returned the WRONG BINDING for a default-exported
  namespace object. typebox's `src/index.ts` does `import * as Type
  from './typebox.ts'; export default Type`, another module declares a
  top-level `const Type`, phase 1 renamed the namespace object to
  `Type$185` — into `namespace_local_renames` — and `resolve_export`'s
  fallback read only `rename_per_module`, which has no entry for a
  namespace local, so the consumer's import stayed spelled `Type` and
  bound to the unrelated arrow. `Type.Number is not a function`. Eighth
  time a fact written in one place was re-derived incompletely by a
  second consumer, and `--verify` detects none of this class: every
  name resolves, it just resolves to the wrong thing. The package entry
  cannot reach it, because nothing imports a barrel's own default.
  Every harness above measures mtsc against ITSELF or against a
  case somebody wrote. `just compare-terser-bundles` measures it
  against terser on real bundles, same input, and that number was very
  different: `compare-terser` stood at 32 win / 0 loss on 34
  hand-written cases while mtsc was **+51.6% behind terser on typebox**.
  Both true — a case corpus covers the rules somebody thought of. Raw
  bytes now say mtsc is smaller on 5 of 9; GZIPPED it is smaller on 1 of
  9, and gzip is what ships. remeda is −388 raw and **+152 gzipped**,
  which means the bytes removed were bytes gzip would have removed
  anyway, so a harness counting raw bytes scores the wrong thing.
  typebox's +51.6% was ONE `.name` read in a 5,000-line bundle:
  `IsEqual(proto.constructor.name, "Object")`. `observed_names.mbt`
  reserves every callable when a `.name` read's receiver cannot be
  narrowed to a class hierarchy, `proto.constructor` cannot be, and the
  fail-closed answer is the wildcard — 119,933 -> 90,042 with the read
  deleted, 842 top-level functions going from fully spelled out to one
  or two characters. Two changes recover it, both reusing trusted
  machinery. `call_inline` required every ARGUMENT to be pure, which
  since the getter fix excludes every property read, so a one-line
  `IsEqual` helper was never inlined at any call site reading a
  property; that requirement exists to stop duplicating, dropping or
  reordering an argument's effects, and all three are questions about
  the BODY — when it reads every parameter exactly once, in argument
  order, unconditionally, substitution reproduces the call's evaluation
  exactly (`params_read_in_argument_order`, an allowlist so a new node
  declines rather than assuming an order nobody checked). And
  `collect_read_property_names_expr` now recognises
  `<expr>.constructor.name === "lit"` and records the LITERAL instead of
  the reserve-everything sentinel. Recognising it inside the TRUSTED
  walker is what makes the narrowing complete by construction: a read in
  any other position still falls through and still reserves everything,
  so a missed shape costs bytes rather than correctness — the opposite
  fail direction from the sentinel channel itself. Reserving the literal
  does both jobs, because a reserved name is also withheld from the
  generated pool: a class already called that keeps its name, and no
  class can be renamed TO it. typebox 119,933 -> 90,056, +51.3% ->
  +13.8%, gzip +27.1% -> +17.4%, and the other eight targets
  byte-identical.
  The next attribution of that gap said "414 single-call functions mtsc
  keeps against terser's 113, worth ~5,000 bytes if inlined", and the
  experiment says the mechanism is wrong twice over. Only 4 of the 371
  such functions are called in STATEMENT position — the 1% the plan
  proposed starting from — and 313 already have the `return <expr>`
  shape `call_inline` structurally accepts, so a statement body was
  never the blocker. The real blocker was the body-purity REQUIREMENT
  (586 of ~1,000 functions examined on typebox, against 35 accepted),
  which is not needed for safety: the body runs once at the call site
  either way, so what it needs is pure arguments and a size argument,
  not purity. Relaxing it is -26 bytes on typebox and 0 on the other
  eight; relaxing the blanket nested-function refusal (394 more
  candidates, because a one-line TS helper is routinely
  `return xs.map(x => …)`) is 0, because those then stop at the size
  gate; and removing the size gate — the ceiling for any cost model on
  multi-site inlining — is +1,896 on typebox, +1,009 excalidraw, +363
  superstruct, +306 ts-pattern, +208 hono. A node-count cost model was
  swept and has no positive region (K=4 already loses 208 on hono). All
  of it reverted.
  What DID pay came from measuring the output a different way:
  `compare-terser-bundles --names` counts identifier lengths in
  VARIABLE positions, and 5,165 of typebox's 11,228-byte gap was
  identifier CHARACTERS — with 828 four-character variable identifiers
  against terser's four, in a bundle where neither has exhausted length
  3. A mangled-name distribution cannot look like that, so those were
  names the mangler declined to rename, and they were one name: `type`,
  824 times, as in `function a6(type, a = {})`. Cause:
  `mangler_builtin_reserved` is consulted by `ScopeFrame::bind` for two
  different questions at once — which names the pool may not GENERATE
  (its purpose: globals and reserved words) and which existing bindings
  may not be RENAMED. `type`, `namespace`, `declare`, `abstract` and
  `readonly` are TypeScript CONTEXTUAL keywords and legal JavaScript
  variable names, in strict mode too, so listing them only ever cost
  bytes; `interface` / `implements` / `private` / `protected` /
  `public` / `static` / `enum` are reserved in strict mode and a module
  is strict, so they stay. Dropping the five: `typescript.js` -13,613,
  typebox -2,440, react -1,939, excalidraw -236, valibot -99, immer
  -45, superstruct -8, nothing larger — about -18.4 KB, and typebox's
  gap +14.2% -> +11.1% with mtsc now smaller on 6 of 9 raw.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case56-contextual-keyword-bindings` covers
  the safety side under Node: each of the five declared, read, closed
  over, shadowed by a parameter, shadowed again in a nested function,
  exported, alongside object KEYS of the same spelling that must not
  move. The first version of that identifier count was itself the trap
  this file keeps recording — every `Identifier` node in the TypeScript
  AST includes property names, so typebox's JSON-Schema `type` key
  showed up 856 times and the column was mostly not identifiers at all.
  The remaining 2,701 characters are 421 fewer one-character names,
  1,499 more two-character ones, and 1,091 more identifier occurrences,
  and that is a PASS-ORDER question rather than a missing pass: terser
  inlines and then mangles, so every deleted declaration frees a
  one-character slot, while mtsc has spent its names before `inline`
  runs.
  Writing the case for that found a WORSE bug underneath, and it was
  pre-existing: `try_inline_trivial_call` substituted parameters ONE AT
  A TIME, so a later parameter's substitution rewrote a name an earlier
  one had just introduced. `const add = (a, b) => a + b` with a
  top-level `let b = 3` compiled `add(b, 1)` to `b + b` and then
  `1 + 1` — three call sites returning 2 / 200 / 14 where the answers
  are 4 / 103 / 10, under the shipping flag set, with no crash and no
  free variable, so `--verify` cannot see it. Both arguments are pure,
  so it had nothing to do with the relaxation above. What makes it the
  normal case rather than an exotic one is the pass ORDER: the mangler
  runs BEFORE inlining, so parameters are named `a`, `b`, `c` and so are
  the top-level bindings the arguments mention. Fixed by substituting
  simultaneously, as two phases through the existing one-name
  substitution via a `@@inline-arg:<i>` placeholder no identifier can
  equal. It is pinned by a UNIT test rather than a corpus case, and that
  was decided by measurement: the fixture written first still PASSED
  with the fix mutated out, because end to end the collision needs the
  mangler to hand a top-level binding the same short name as a later
  parameter, and there it did not. A case that cannot fail while the bug
  is present is coverage-shaped, so it was deleted rather than shipped.
  `--rules` then asks TERSER to price its own compress rules — run it
  once per rule with that rule off — which is the ceiling for porting
  each one, known before writing any of it. It corrected a ranking made
  by COUNTING: mtsc emits 9x fewer comma-fused statements than terser
  (valibot 322 vs 36), so `sequences` looked like the biggest gap;
  priced across nine targets it is +1,500 bytes and sixth of eight,
  while `join_vars` is +15,522 (+1,875 gzipped) and `conditionals`
  +8,774. Same failure mode as `computed_props`, `loops` and `typeofs`
  before it — a label or a count standing in for the objective — except
  this time it was caught before the work.
  Every harness above is a differential: it needs a second thing to
  compare against, so it only covers inputs somebody arranged.
  `verify.mbt` (`mtsc --verify`) is the one total check — it re-parses the
  emitted bundle and asks whether every name it reads resolves to
  something, sharing no code with the passes that made the deletions. It
  is deliberately fail-quiet, because a verifier that cries wolf gets
  turned off. Its first run on the corpus turned four silent liveness
  bugs into named free variables, and fixing them found a fifth: plain
  `mtsc --mangle`, no flags, renamed a multi-declarator group while
  leaving a reference that preceded it spelled the old way. Two of the
  four were the same missing `PureCall` arm surfacing as two unrelated
  symptoms — with `TypeArgs` before them, that is twice that a wrapper
  node's fail-open default has cost a soundness bug, and the reason to
  expect a third. See
  [`docs/type-aware-dce.md`](./docs/type-aware-dce.md).
  What none of these harnesses caught is the worst bug in this list, and
  the way it surfaced says why: porting the terser rules meant reading
  `as_const_inline.mbt`'s walker, and it had no scope narrowing at all.
  It resolves a name against one top-level table, so

      const S = ["ok", "warn"];
      function f() { const S = ["x", "y"]; return S[0]; }
      function h(S) { return S[0]; }

  compiled both `f()` and `h(["param"])` to `"ok"` — a wrong VALUE, not
  a free variable or a crash, under plain `--bundle --fold`, and for a
  parameter as readily as for an inner declaration. `call_inline.mbt`
  had solved exactly this and written it up at the top of the file
  ("the table is keyed by name and carried into every scope"); the
  second pass to need it never got it. The narrowing helpers are now
  generic and shared, and the tables the walker carries live in one
  struct so a scope boundary cannot narrow one and forget the other.
  `--verify` cannot see this class of bug — every name still resolves —
  which is the argument for the execution-differential harnesses, and
  the argument against believing the corpus covers a pass just because
  the pass has tests. Finding one was the reason to audit every pass
  that resolves a name against a table, and **four more had it**:
  `const_enum_inline` (wrong under `--bundle` alone, with no
  optimization flag), `predicate_inline`, `switch_fold`, and
  `type_fold`. All five produce a wrong value, none produces a crash
  or a free variable, and `--verify` detects none of them.
  `const_enum_inline`'s keys are dotted paths (`"E.M"`), so its
  narrowing matches the first segment; `type_fold` already had a
  layered `TypeScope` with a `hide` its parameter path called and its
  declaration path did not, so an inner `const` with no useful type
  left the outer annotation visible. `fixtures/mangle-safety/case43-table-shadowing`
  runs all five against Node, pairing each shadowed read with an
  unshadowed one so the fix cannot be "switch the pass off".
  All five of those are about the table's KEY, and there is a SECOND
  half that nothing asked for a long time: dropping the entry whose key
  a scope re-binds says nothing about the names the substituted VALUE
  reads, and those get re-resolved wherever the value lands.
  `const base = Number(process.argv.length); const f = () => base;
  function g() { const other = 99; return f() + other * 0 }` printed 99
  where the answer is 2, under the full shipping flag set. The mangler
  runs BEFORE the inline phase and gave `base` and `other` the same
  short name `a` — legitimately, since at mangle time `g`'s body does
  not mention `base`, so shadowing it is free — and then the inliner
  spliced a body whose `a` is the outer one into a scope where `a` is
  99. No crash and no free variable, so `--verify` cannot see it, and
  the better the mangler does its job the more often it fires. Four
  tables substitute a value that can carry free variables and none
  checked: `call_inline`, `as_const_inline` (both halves),
  `predicate_inline`, `switch_fold`; `const_enum_inline` and
  `type_fold` substitute literals and are safe by construction. The
  fix is in the shared helper, and the obligation is a TRAIT rather
  than an optional predicate — a table whose value type cannot answer
  does not compile, where a defaulted "mentions nothing" would fail
  open and the next table added would be the fifth. Free names come
  from `collect_var_refs_expr`, the mangler's own walker, which has no
  fail-open catch-all because the mangler's correctness depends on its
  completeness. Two of the four could be demonstrated end to end;
  `as_const_inline` and `predicate_inline` run BEFORE the mangler, so
  the mangler cleans up after them and no witness could be produced —
  they are covered by construction and by a unit test at the pass
  boundary, and are NOT claimed to be broken.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case55-inlined-value-free-variable` pins it
  under Node and fails when the value half is mutated off.
  The SEVENTH instance is in the LINKER, and it is the last place the
  question had not been asked. Phase 2 records
  `subs[local_alias] = resolved` and phase 3 rewrites `Var(local_alias)`
  to `Var(resolved)` inside the importing module; the walker tracks
  shadowing of the name it REPLACES and cannot track shadowing of the
  name it SUBSTITUTES, because that name is not in the map it narrows.
  `@sprawlens/viz`'s `App.tsx` has
  `import { parentFileOf as contractParentFileOf }` and, in the same
  component body, a local `const parentFileOf` — correct as written,
  two different names. `contractParentFileOf` appears ZERO times in the
  bundle: every use became `parentFileOf`, which there is the local
  `const`, and `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'parentFileOf' before
  initialization` under plain `mtsc --bundle` with no optimization flag.
  A 265-file preact application bundled and could not run. The other
  half of the same capture is silent — when the shadowing declaration
  has already initialized there is no TDZ, just the local function's
  answer instead of the import's, which `--verify` cannot see either.
  The fix is NOT a scope walk at the rewrite site: a walk has to model
  every binder form and the cost of missing one is this bug returning
  quietly. Instead, phase 2 already computes `resolved != local_alias`,
  which IS the hazard condition, so a phase 1.5 forces the exporting
  binding to a MINTED name whenever it holds — `name$N` is not a name
  source code declares, so no scope can shadow it and no analysis is
  needed to know that. Only bindings imported under a different alias
  move, and with `--mangle` the names are replaced anyway, so the
  corpus is byte-identical.
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case57-aliased-import-shadowed-target` runs
  four shapes under Node — the TDZ form, the silent wrong-value form, a
  PARAMETER named after the target (no block declares it, the same trap
  as `case43`), and an unshadowed control that must still reach the
  import so the fix cannot be "stop substituting" — and fails under
  mutation. `@sprawlens/viz` now goes 875,544 -> 357,712 bytes (59%)
  and renders an identical DOM optimized and not.
  It is the corpus's tenth target and its first real APPLICATION —
  `packages/viz/src/main.tsx` mounts a preact app, exports NOTHING, and
  spans 162 TypeScript sources across four workspace packages — and it
  answers the question the other nine could not. The type-reading phases
  are worth +10,419 bytes (2.81%), +2,491 gzipped there, against
  typebox's +216 and zero on six of the nine libraries: the whole
  library side of the corpus adds up to under twelve bytes. Feeding
  `.ts` is what buys it — the erased leg is 380,833 against the typed
  leg's 370,414 — which is exactly the difference `verify-real-world`
  cannot see, because published `.js` makes the answer zero by
  construction. For the property mangler the answer is still NO (743
  distinct property names, 0 candidates, the same suppression), and the
  REASON is the finding: on a library `--explain-mangle` names the
  export surface and the wire format, which are correct and unfixable,
  while here every cause reads "binding X crosses the bundle boundary
  and carries no closed type annotation" — `readSearch`, `parsers`,
  `url`, `onPopState`, `node`, `cell`, `edge`, `id`. An application's
  boundary is not its exports; it is the DOM and framework APIs it hands
  objects to, which is a boundary a type annotation can narrow.
  Getting it to run cost four bugs, none of them reachable by a
  library-shaped target: tsconfig `jsx` / `jsxImportSource` /
  `jsxFactory` were never read; `BundleOptions.jsx` was ignored by
  `load_module_graph`, so `--jsx-import-source` was dead in the bundle
  path and a preact app compiled to `react/jsx-runtime`; the linker
  capture above; and `for (var u; …)` — a declaration with no
  initializer, in ordinary JavaScript out of preact's own source — came
  out as `for (var u = __ts_no_init__; …)`, which throws a
  `ReferenceError` the moment the loop runs. `omit_declaration_init`
  says in its own doc comment that the marker "has to be dropped in
  every mode", and the block-statement emit, the declarator-group emit
  and the multi-decl for-head emit all call it; the single-declaration
  for-head arm wrote `= <init>` unconditionally. Eighth time one rule
  was written in several places and applied in one, so the three kinds
  now share one path.
  Two harness defects came with it. `countSources` counted only `*.ts`,
  which is every library in the corpus and 26 of viz's 126 files. And
  `--only X --update` REPLACED `expected.json` with a single row,
  silently deleting the nine recorded baselines — a regression check
  whose baseline a convenience flag can erase is not a regression check.
  `--update` merges now and reports how many rows it carried over.
  The linker fix itself costs
  nothing: `typescript.js` byte-identical, the nine type-aware targets
  −76 bytes net (typebox +327 and excalidraw +150 against ts-pattern
  −345, immer −192, hono −16, because fewer inlines leave the
  single-use binding inliner and treeshake a better shape), and the
  `inline` phase 397 -> 351 ms.
  A 3400-seed campaign then found the escape analysis missing two of
  the six ways JS spells an assignment. `sg_record_write_into` was
  called from the four that go through a member expression and from
  neither `Assign`/`AssignExpr` nor any `CompoundAssign*`, so
  `let v: any = 1; v = { ...obj, g14: 100 }; console.log([v])` dropped
  `g14` and emptied `obj`, while the identical program spelled
  `bag.beta = { ...obj, g14: 100 }` kept both — the difference was not
  a judgement about escape but which arm of the walker the statement
  landed in. `--explain-mangle` said it in one line: "reaches a
  side-effect sink" was EMPTY. The same campaign found the parser
  committing to a generic call inside a bracket it had not closed:
  `try_skip_type_args` aborts on a closer it never opened but never
  required its brace/paren/bracket counts to be ZERO where `depth`
  reached 0, so `a < (b > (c))` consumed `< ( b >`, saw the following
  `(`, and left a stray `)` behind as "Expected RParen, got RParen".
  Its last finding is the one place a rewrite duplicated its input:
  a switch whose every case ends in a terminator is lowered to an
  if-else chain, and the chain tests the SCRUTINEE once per named case
  where the switch evaluates it once — so
  `switch ((trace.push(2), obj?.gamma))` pushed `2` twice. That now
  requires a pure scrutinee, which also rules out a value that could
  change between reads. Its last finding was the deepest:
  `class C { m() {} } console.log(new C())` deleted `m` under plain
  `mtsc --bundle`, because `class_method_dce`'s `keep` was the export
  surface and nothing else — the pass had no notion of a class value
  crossing the bundle boundary, so a library bundle was protected and an
  application bundle not at all. The real-world form is the protocol
  methods a library never calls itself: `JSON.stringify` calls
  `toJSON`, `String(x)` calls `toString`, `await` calls `then`. Feeding
  the pass `collect_externally_visible_props` was tried and reverted:
  that set answers the property mangler's question ("may this NAME be
  renamed") and is right to be broader, since a rename must be
  consistent everywhere a name occurs, so it marks a class observed when
  an instance merely appears in an escaping subtree —
  `console.log(new C().live())` reserved everything and three
  dce-coverage cases regressed. Deletion is the stronger claim and needs
  the narrower fact: `class_members_reachable_off_bundle` pins on
  `External` observability alone (every level below it is a KNOWN sink,
  and a known sink invokes nothing arbitrary) plus the fixed
  `sink_invoked_protocol_methods` list, and `class_method_dce_block`
  takes it with NO default, so a caller that cannot answer gets a pass
  that declines rather than one that deletes. Two things turned up
  underneath. `collect_immediate_sources` answered `Unknown` for
  `new C()`, so `const w = new Widget(); register(w)` stopped
  propagating at `w` and never reached `Widget`, while the inline
  `register(new Widget())` did — one program, two spellings, two
  answers, and the spelling that lost is the one real code uses. And
  `analyze_observability`'s worklist scanned every flow edge per popped
  symbol, O(symbols x edges); it already built a reverse index for
  `FuncArg` and none for `SymVal`. That was 40 of the 43 seconds
  `--bundle --mangle` spent on the 9 MB TypeScript bundle, invisible
  while `--mangle-properties` was the only consumer. Indexed:
  43.8s -> 4.7s, and 85.3s -> 7.0s with property mangling on, output
  byte-identical and the type-aware corpus unchanged on all ten
  targets. Seed 1261 itself was a false positive of the harness —
  `console.log`, `util.inspect`, `JSON.stringify`, `String(x)` and
  `Object.keys` all print `C {}` whether or not `C.prototype.m` exists,
  so `fuzz-runner.mjs` reflecting on a prototype at a `console.log` was
  reaching past the program's own sinks. It no longer does in the sink
  shape and still does in the export shape, where a library consumer
  really can call anything; the hazard the sink shape cannot reach
  (`console.log` being its only sink) lives in
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case45-class-escapes-external`, where a real
  external import receives the instance and calls the method back.
  The four export-surface holes above are the newest entry in the same
  ledger, and the reason they survived thousands of seeds is three gaps
  in the grammar: `mutableTarget()` has no `this.<field>` arm, so
  `this.slot ??= new Payload()` — hono's real `#req ??=`, and the way
  ordinary code writes a lazily-created member — was ungeneratable; its
  index arm targets `arr` with a NUMERIC literal, never `obj["p"]`; and a
  class instance was never written into a property whose holder is then
  observed, so the export-surface route was never taken. `lazyHolderGroup`
  emits a payload class whose ONLY route to a consumer is one property
  write, rotating over `??=`, `||=`, `this["slot"] =`, a read-through
  object (carrying the self-referential increment that made the fixed
  walk hang), and plain `=` as the control — without which "fixed" and
  "switched off" look alike from outside. It needed NO runner change:
  `encode` already walks an exported instance's own fields and reports the
  inner object's prototype members, and the payload is deliberately NOT
  exported, since exporting it would put its members on the surface
  directly and the write would stop being the only route. Detection comes
  from the REFERENCE leg, the deletion being present in every mtsc leg.
  Proven the only way that counts — against the compiler with the fix
  reverted it reports at SEED 0, shrunk 107 nodes to 6 and correctly
  attributed as a lowering rather than a mangling bug — and 700 seeds are
  clean with the fix in. The `#private` spelling is deliberately absent:
  `Object.keys` cannot see a private field, so this observation cannot
  reach it whatever the compiler does, and `case61` covers it.
  That protocol list then turned out to stop one step short of the
  ITERATION protocol, and its own comment is where it stopped: it said
  a spread obtains an iterator through `Symbol.iterator`, a computed key
  nothing could drop, without noticing that the object that returns has
  a `next` which is a plain identifier the pass could and did drop. So
  `class C { [Symbol.iterator]() { return this } next() {…} }` with
  `[...new C()]` as its only consumer compiled to a class with no `next`
  and the spread threw. `mangle.mbt`'s built-in reserved list had
  `next`/`return`/`throw`/`done`/`value` under a `// Iterator protocol`
  comment the whole time — renaming was never at risk, only deletion,
  because `class_method_dce` reads a different set. A unit test now
  checks the containment so the two cannot drift again, and
  `fixtures/mangle-safety/case47-iteration-protocol` runs a spread, a
  `for…of` that breaks (so `return` fires) and a generator under Node.
  The same probe-by-hand pass then found the clearest possible case for
  the mangler's reserved list missing from it: `Object.defineProperty`
  hands the runtime an object it reads BY NAME, and three of a
  descriptor's six keys were absent. `get`, `set` and `value` were
  present only incidentally — under Map/Set and the iterator protocol —
  so nothing had ever named the descriptor, and the three flags nobody
  else needed were not there. The breakage was the DEAD-PROPERTY pass
  rather than a rename: `{ value: 1, enumerable: true }` became
  `{ value: 1 }`, and since every `defineProperty` default is `false`,
  dropping a `true` flag inverts it — `Object.keys` silently stopped
  seeing the property, `writable: true` made a later assignment throw in
  the module's strict mode, and `configurable: true` made `delete`
  throw. Dropping a `false` flag is harmless, which is exactly why two
  of the first three probes passed and the shape looked safe.
  `Object.defineProperties`, `Object.create(proto, descriptors)` and an
  accessor pair were all correct already.
  Three constructs the generator had never emitted were probed by hand
  first. Inheritance came back CLEAN across seventeen shapes — override
  dispatch, `super.m()`, a three-level chain, a getter override,
  inherited fields through `JSON.stringify` and `Object.keys`, static
  inheritance, cross-module `extends`, `instanceof`,
  `this.constructor.name` — the one apparent difference being
  `console.log(new Sub())` printing a mangled name, which is
  `observed_names.mbt`'s stated position (it reserves `.name` reads IN
  THE SOURCE; `util.inspect` printing a constructor name is not one, and
  `fuzz-runner`'s `encode` excludes `name` for the same reason). It is
  in the generator now to KEEP it clean, not because it broke. Async is
  deliberately absent: the observation is synchronous, so an `async`
  function's effects land after it and both legs would agree on an empty
  trace — coverage-shaped and proving nothing. Eight await shapes were
  checked by hand instead.
  Re-profiling after all of that found the same shape once more, and
  this time the largest item was pure waste. On the 9 MB TypeScript
  compiler under the shipping flags, `class-method-dce` plus its
  reachability phase were 27.8% of a 7,679 ms compile — and
  `--disable-phase class-method-dce` produced BYTE-IDENTICAL output,
  because the pass is SUPPRESSED there by one `all[name]` read in 5,000
  lines and its own report says "nothing would have been dropped
  anyway". Two fixes, both about asking the cheap question first.
  `class_members_reachable_off_bundle` is a full observability analysis
  and ran unconditionally BEFORE the suppression was known, so
  `off_bundle` is a thunk now: `None` still means "the caller cannot
  answer", so the fail-closed property is unchanged — the presence check
  is up front and only the work moved. And sub-phase timing inside the
  pass showed the cost split as symbol graph 485 ms, numeric inference
  226 ms, static accesses 31 ms, container facts 18 ms: the two
  expensive halves exist only to decide whether a computed key COULD
  name a method, which is a question about whether a drop is safe, and
  there is no point asking it when there is nothing to drop. Whether
  there is anything to drop needs only the static-access set and the
  export surface, both SUBSETS of the real accessed set, so "nothing
  unreached" cannot become "something unreached" once the expensive
  analysis adds names. The pass left the table entirely. Then the
  biggest number was `bundle: link + escape + emit`, which is a
  RESIDUAL — the whole bundle call minus the instrumented phases — so
  the largest cost in the compile was being reported as unattributed;
  splitting out `escape analysis` (2,165 ms) also exposed that
  `--explain-mangle` was computing `escape_breakdown` TWICE, once for
  the per-reason report and once through
  `collect_externally_visible_props`, so the merge is a separate
  `merge_escape_breakdown` now. `--mangle` 7,760 -> 5,190 ms (-33%),
  with `--mangle-properties` 11,800 -> 8,230 ms (-30%), excalidraw
  2,400 -> 2,050 ms, output byte-identical in every configuration.
  excalidraw keeps 106 ms of `class-method-dce` — there the early exit
  does NOT fire, which is what selective looks like — and
  `bundle_wbtest.mbt` pins both sides of that boundary. The two
  residuals left after that round are now phases, and a residual is a
  subtraction rather than a measurement, so both were worth the phase.
  One was a real waste: `cli: module graph walk` was not a walk at all
  but the sibling ambient `.d.ts` scan, which next to
  `node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js` reads AND fully parses 98
  files and 3.2 MB — where the parse only fills `type_props` and only
  `--reserve-typed-props` reads that. The main loop had exactly that
  gate on its own second parse and the ambient scan never got it; fourth
  time a condition was written in one place and not in the second
  consumer. The other was MY OWN instrumentation: `cli: import edge
  walk` read 358 ms and looked like the largest item on a 95-file
  target, but it was a plain wall-clock bracket while the resolution
  sub-spans accumulated INSIDE it — the spans OVERLAPPED, so module
  resolution was counted twice. An overlapping span is not a small
  error, it is a wrong number that reads like a finding, and it sent the
  investigation at the wrong function; the right answer was already
  written in `main.mbt` ("module resolution, not parsing, was the
  largest phase on every multi-file target"). Made disjoint, the edge
  walk is 7 ms and the largest row is `cli: resolve module paths` at
  331 ms — 53 ms of relative path arithmetic against 272 ms of bare
  specifiers, and `module_resolver.mbt` had no cache of any kind. The
  first fix bought exactly ZERO: memoizing the ANSWER, keyed on (mode,
  importing file, specifier), because the key HAS to include the
  importer (a nested `node_modules` can resolve one specifier two ways)
  and 68 importers of `clsx` are 68 distinct keys that share nothing.
  The repeats were real and the memo could not see them: what repeats
  across importers is the WORK, not the question. Memoizing the work —
  `@fs.kind`, file text reads, `@fs.realpath` — is what paid, and the
  text read is where it was: `resolve_tsconfig_specifier` runs per bare
  specifier per importer and re-read every config from disk each time,
  twice per level (once for `paths`, once for `extends`), over a
  two-level `extends` chain. 272 -> 71 ms, excalidraw 1,536 -> 1,405 ms
  (-8.5%), byte-identical. Splitting `bundle: link` (51 ms),
  `bundle: emit` (231 ms) and `observed-names` (48 ms) out of the other
  residual takes it from 1,744 ms / 20.1% to 247 ms / 5.1% — sixth row
  rather than first, and what is left is statement concatenation and
  inter-phase bookkeeping, which is now known to be cheap rather than
  unmeasured. The profile that comes out the far side says the
  optimizer is no longer the question: `mangle` and `peephole` are
  30.4% of a 4.8 s compile and both are real work, while reading,
  tokenizing and parsing are 27.6% between them. See
  [`docs/real-world-minify.md`](./docs/real-world-minify.md).
- `src/bridge` consumes `src/checker` for every type-shape decision and runs
  `@checker.check_module` on the synthesized output as a sanity gate. It also
  keeps domain-specific specialization for Node FS / React / Hono / crypto /
  class-shape generation, plus `.mbti` -> `.d.ts` emission for MoonBit-generated
  packages.

## Dependencies

- `moonbitlang/async` - async file I/O for the CLI.

## Commands

```bash
# Check for errors
moon check --deny-warn

# Run tests. Takes about an hour, and most of that is NOT tests: the
# `*_bench_wbtest.mbt` files use the `(it : @bench.T)` signature, whose
# `it.bench(fn() { … })` runs its body many times to get a timing, and
# `moon test` executes those loops too. The checker's bench alone is
# 20-30 minutes of CPU in one process at 100%, which is indistinguishable
# from a hang — this was mistaken for one twice, once correctly (an
# O(n^2) rule, see batch CP) and once not. To tell them apart, run the
# one file: `moon test --target native src/checker/expr_check_wbtest.mbt`
# is ~10 seconds, so if THAT hangs the problem is real.
moon test --target native

# Run parser microbenchmarks
moon bench --target native

# Format code
moon fmt

# Generate type definitions
moon info

# Validate `--mangle-properties` against the mangle-safety corpus
just verify-mangle-safety
```

## Notes

- Target: `native`.
- The repo no longer ships a JS interpreter or wasm codegen; entry-point
  parsing is read-only and produces declarations / bridge code only.
