checker-conformance-oracle *ARGS:
    bash scripts/checker_conformance_oracle.sh {{ ARGS }}

# Rank the conformance MISSes so the next batch can be chosen instead of
# guessed. The oracle above gates on FP and prints "MISS 344", which ranks
# nothing — a baseline NAME list says that TS7 errored, not what it said.
# This reads the codes out of the submodule baselines and reports, per code,
# `solo` (files where it is the ONLY lever, so the guaranteed yield) beside
# `total`, then a greedy cover of the whole MISS set. Read both with the
# caveats in the script header: the unit that flips is a FILE not a
# (file, code) pair, a code is not a difficulty class, and a corpus count is
# not real-world frequency. `--code TS2322` lists one bucket's files with
# each file's other codes; `--refresh` recomputes the cached per-file
# classification (minutes), re-bucketing from the cache is instant.
# Opt-in (not part of `ci`).
checker-miss-buckets *ARGS:
    node scripts/checker_miss_buckets.mjs {{ ARGS }}

# Soundness gate: build the native binary and fail if the checker reports
# more conformance false positives than the current budget. The oracle
# script skips cleanly when the `typescript` submodule isn't populated, so
# this is safe to run anywhere. The budget is 0: the checker reports no
# false positives on the conformance corpus.
#
# `--max-miss` gates the OTHER direction, which nothing used to watch: a
# rule that stops firing moves a file from TP to MISS, and every other
# number here absorbs that silently. The budget is the current in-scope
# MISS count (`scripts/checker_out_of_scope.txt` holds the declared
# remainder, `docs/checker-triage.md` the argument) — lower it whenever a
# batch improves it, the same way the FP budget only ever tightened.

# Is any checker rule superlinear in the size of a module-wide list?
#
# `verify-checker-soundness` asks whether the answer is RIGHT, over 4,484
# conformance files that are a few dozen lines each — so a rule quadratic
# in the number of interfaces, classes or exports in ONE file is invisible
# to it, and to the test suite. Two such rules have shipped: batch CP's
# TS5076 span scan (a 9 MB file went from seconds to 180+, at 100% CPU for
# 36 minutes before anyone looked), and three nested scans added at once
# in batches CY-DB, which cost 6.5x at 4,000 interfaces while the oracle
# stayed at FP 0 and every test stayed green.
#
# So this asks by GROWTH rather than by stopwatch: a size ladder per axis,
# with an exponent fitted from the endpoints. Linear is ~1.0, quadratic
# ~2.0, and anything over the budget fails and names the axis. On its
# first run it found a quadratic the fix above had missed and a second one
# that predated the whole batch series.

# Compare against terser on the same input. Both optimizers start from

# Every rewrite, checked against every awkward value. Each peephole /

# What the type information actually buys, in bytes. Each target is a
# real package cloned from git and optimized twice with identical flags,
# differing only in the input: the TypeScript SOURCE (so the six
# type-driven phases can fire) versus the same code with its types
# erased (so none of them can). `verify-real-world` cannot measure this
# — it feeds published `.js`, where the answer is zero by construction.
#
# All three legs must produce identical observations against the
# target's driver, or the row is not evidence. Needs network on the
# first run; shares the `verify-real-world` checkouts where it can.
#
# `--app` compiles an APPLICATION that consumes each library instead of
# the library's own package entry, which is the only way to ask two of
# these questions honestly: a barrel's exports are all live, so
# tree-shaking has nothing to remove, and a library's property names ARE
# its wire format, so the mangler is right to reserve them. The usage in
# each app entry is copied from that library's own README — see
# `fixtures/type-aware-corpus/app-entries/README.md`.

# Fuzz the property mangler: generate programs nobody wrote, compile each

# Minify real published packages (react, the TypeScript compiler) and

# Every combination of {treeshake, fold, minify, mangle} on the 9 MB
# published TypeScript compiler, each run afterwards AS a compiler and
# compared against the pristine copy. `verify-real-world` checks the one
# shipping flag set; this checks all sixteen, so a failure names the pass
# — a combination that breaks while each of its parts passes is an
# interaction between them. Needs `verify-real-world` to have populated
# the cache first.
#
# A SECOND table runs the same combinations over
# `fixtures/pass-lattice/lowerings.ts` — one of every TypeScript-only
# lowering — and observes VALUES rather than stdout: own keys,
# `JSON.stringify`, spread, `for…in`. The 9 MB target cannot ask either
# question (published `.js` has no `#private` fields, no enums, no
# namespaces, and stdout never shows an extra own property), which is why
# this harness ran the guilty combination on every run while bare
# `--bundle` leaked mtsc's private-field brand. Re-introducing that bug
# fails the second table and names the leaked brands.

# Does the module-graph walk stay linear in the graph? It did not: the

# already-loaded module, and every repeat visit re-read the file,
# re-parsed it and re-pushed its imports. On a diamond graph that is
# 2^depth — zod could not finish parsing 133 files in eighteen minutes.

# Where the compile time goes. Runs the same size ladder as

# mtsc against terser on REAL bundles, not hand-written cases.
#
# `compare-terser` asks "is the rule we thought of missing?" over 34
# cases, and it stood at 32 win / 0 loss while mtsc was 51% behind terser
# on a real library. This asks the blunt question: same input (each
# type-aware target's unoptimized bundle), terser's compress+mangle
# against mtsc's full pipeline, raw AND gzipped.
#
# GZIP is the number that matters — nobody ships unzipped JS, and the
# two metrics disagree: mtsc has been smaller raw and larger gzipped on
# the same target.
#
# `--rules` asks TERSER to price its own compress rules, by running it
# once per rule with that rule off. That is the ceiling for porting each
# one, measured before writing any of it — and it corrected a ranking
# that had been made by counting occurrences instead of bytes.
