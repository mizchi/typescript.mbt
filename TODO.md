# TODO

The wasm interpreter / codegen / AOT compiler that originally lived in this
repo has been removed. Items below are scoped to the bridge generator only.

## Interop Bridge Quality Roadmap: 60% -> 90%

Current assessment: the project is around 55-60% complete as a practical
`TypeScript <-> MoonBit` interoperability bridge. It is usable for selected
packages under supervision, but not yet reliable enough for arbitrary npm or
MoonBit packages without inspection.

Target: reach about 90% practical quality for the declared supported surface.
This does not mean "all TypeScript semantics"; it means generated bridges are
predictable, self-diagnosing, build-backed, and runnable for a broad real-world
corpus without manual edits.

### 90% Quality Gate

- [x] `just ci` passes with all fixture-backed bridge/scaffold checks.
- [x] `just verify-realworld-typescript` passes with a fixed corpus of at least
  20 npm / Node entrypoints.
- [x] `just verify-realworld-moonbit` passes with a fixed corpus of at least 15
  local MoonBit packages.
- [x] Every generated TS -> MoonBit package in the real-world corpus passes:
  `moon check --target js`, `moon test --target js`, `moon build --target js`,
  and a Node smoke run.
- [x] Every generated MoonBit -> TS package in the real-world corpus passes:
  `moon build --target js`, TypeScript declaration typecheck, and a Node import
  smoke run for root and subpath exports.
- [x] Unsupported exports are either 0 or limited to explicitly-budgeted
  ambiguous surfaces with actionable diagnostics.
  - `just bridge-quality` now fails on unbudgeted unsupported exports and
    budgets only the single fixture-backed ambiguous re-export surface with
    explicit candidate diagnostics.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` also budgets the single zod
    `ZodFirstPartyTypeKind` empty compatibility enum stub as an omitted,
    runtime-safe unsupported surface.
- [x] `JSValue` usage is classified by reason, and budgets are stable per
  package instead of being treated as an opaque quality number.
  - Real-world TypeScript metrics now split `JSValue` surface usage into
    unknown / any, overload, conditional / mapped, callback / function,
    tuple / array, and namespace / value buckets, with per-package budgets.
- [x] Generated packages require no manual glue edits for the supported corpus.
  - Real-world TypeScript verification hashes generated glue files immediately
    after CLI generation and fails if smoke setup or builds mutate them.
  - Real-world MoonBit verification hashes generated package artifacts and
    fails if typecheck, import smoke, or consumer smoke steps mutate them.
- [x] `README.md` documents the supported surface, unsupported surface, and
  diagnostic interpretation clearly enough for external users.
  - README now documents the supported MoonBit -> TypeScript and TypeScript ->
    MoonBit bridge surfaces, known fallbacks, diagnostics files, quality
    reports, and the no-arbitrary-package-conversion caveat.

### Generated Code Review Follow-up (2026-05-01)

Review status:

- `just verify-examples` passes, including JS build smokes.
- `just bridge-quality` passes with 0 unbudgeted unsupported exports.
- `just verify-realworld-typescript` passes with package-local `JSValue` cause
  budgets and warning-free MoonBit checks.
- A node:fs-only real-world probe builds and runs with 0 unsupported exports.
  Current metrics after callback/option-bag, generic, tuple, and function-type
  cleanup: 2239 bridge lines, 327 declared functions, 12 `JSValue` refs, 2
  `JSValue` functions, and 11 `JSValue` surface lines.

Next implementation tasks:

- [x] Fix callable interface conversion at the JS boundary.
  - Current symptom: React `forwardRef` receives an object converted from
    `ForwardRefRenderFunction` instead of a callable JS function, producing
    `forwardRef requires a render function but was given object.`
  - Target: generated converters for interfaces with a `<call>` / `_call_`
    signature should pass through existing JS functions and wrap MoonBit
    records as callable JS functions while preserving optional properties.
  - Done: `ffi_struct_js_converter_decl` now emits callable wrappers for
    `<call>` interfaces, and the React examples no longer emit the runtime
    `forwardRef` warning.
- [x] Remove package-global opaque generic placeholders such as `type T`,
  `type P`, and `type S` from generated public APIs.
  - Target: preserve representable generics as MoonBit type parameters; if a
    TypeScript generic cannot be represented safely, widen only that local
    boundary to `JSValue` with diagnostics.
  - Done: interface type parameters are preserved in the AST and local generic
    placeholders are widened at the specific boundary instead of emitted as
    package-global opaque types; generated Hono/React/TypeScript AST examples no
    longer leak `type T` / `type P` style placeholders.
- [x] Lower or explicitly budget remaining anonymous literal-union public
  surfaces.
  - Current unbudgeted examples include React `OlHTMLAttributes`, Vitest
    `Assertion` / `VitestUtils` / `SerializedConfig`, and TypeScript AST
    `UserPreferences` / encoded classification request args.
  - Target: create stable synthetic names when a public owner can be inferred,
    otherwise keep the fallback but require an explicit budget and diagnostic.
  - Done: anonymous string literal unions now get stable synthetic enum names
    even when literal values are unsafe as MoonBit case names or appear inside
    function/object/union surfaces. `just bridge-quality` now has 0 unbudgeted
    unsupported exports.
- [x] Reduce node:fs JSValue regressions.
  - Previous node:fs metrics: 2015 bridge lines, 312 declared functions,
    117 JSValue refs, 81 JSValue functions, 0 unsupported exports.
  - Priority: callback aliases, overload-selected sync/promisify wrappers, and
    common option bag aliases such as stat/read/write options.
  - Done: inline callback parameters now receive stable synthetic callback
    opaque types instead of `JSValue`, and named option intersections such as
    `StatOptions & { bigint?: false }` collapse back to the named option bag;
    `StatsBase<T>` / `StatsFsBase<T>` now preserve `T`, and event-map tuple
    payloads keep `Array[Unit]`, `Array[Double]`, or `Array[Error_]` where
    representable. Function types now lower to MoonBit function arrows instead
    of `JSValue`; inline `Promise<{ ... }>` results such as
    `read.__promisify__` / `write.__promisify__` now get named result structs,
    and class method generic bounds keep stream listener event names as
    `String`. Common `writeFile*` / `appendFile*` string data and `cp*` string
    paths now stay typed; `glob*` string patterns and `create*Stream` option
    bags are preserved; promisify file-data wrappers no longer widen string
    data to `JSValue`; stream `path` properties now use `PathLike`, and
    `StatSyncFn` callable options use `StatSyncOptions?`. Stream listener
    payloads now use generated payload opaque types, and redundant
    encoding-dependent overload wrappers with wider returns are skipped.
    `BigIntStats` nanosecond fields now lower to `Int64`, and
    `FSWatcherEventMap.change` uses an opaque payload type instead of
    `Array[JSValue]`; `WatchOptions.encoding` now lowers to `String?`.
    Overload wrapper pruning keeps narrow overloads per arity, so the broad
    `fstatSync` / `statfsSync` union-return wrappers no longer leak `JSValue`
    while bigint variants remain callable. `readFileSync` /
    `readFile.__promisify__` buffer options now use `ReadFileBufferOptions?`,
    `readFileSync` also exposes a `BufferEncoding -> String` wrapper, broad
    `globSync` union-return wrappers are skipped, and `_GlobOptions.cwd`,
    `_GlobOptions.exclude`, and `CopyOptions.filter` now keep concrete MoonBit
    types. Current node:fs budget is 11 `JSValue` surface lines and 2
    `JSValue` functions.
  - Remaining quality debt: event payloads with heterogeneous values still use
    opaque payload boundaries, and custom `fs` implementation hooks / watcher
    ignore predicates still require `JSValue`.
- [x] Split large generated MoonBit packages into reviewable files.
  - Target layout: `types.mbt`, `externs.mbt`, `converters.mbt`, and
    `guards.mbt` for large TS -> MoonBit scaffolds, while preserving generated
    `bridge.mbti` and package metadata.
  - Done: generated TS -> MoonBit packages over the review threshold now split
    MoonBit implementation code into `types.mbt`, `converters.mbt`,
    `externs.mbt`, `guards.mbt`, and `bridge.mbt`. Example/scaffold checks,
    real-world manifests, and bridge quality metrics now count the split source
    files instead of assuming all implementation code lives in `bridge.mbt`.
- [x] Add regression rails for generated-code ergonomics.
  - [x] React `forwardRef` warning should fail the smoke rail.
  - [x] TypeScript AST transformer smoke should reduce required `unsafeCast`
    usage around `ScriptTarget`, `transform`, visitors, and transformed arrays.
  - [x] node:fs budget regressions should fail with package-local diagnostics.

### Package-Specific Practical Coverage Pass (2026-05-01)

Implemented in the current real-world TypeScript probe order:

- [x] Small Node built-ins now target zero public `JSValue` fallback.
  - `node:path`, `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, and `node:buffer`
    all generate with `JSValue surface = 0` in
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md`.
  - The corresponding real-world budgets in
    `scripts/verify_realworld_typescript.sh` are fixed at 0 so regressions fail.
- [x] `node:crypto` focused pass.
  - Common option bags, AAD options, key-like parameters, WebCrypto algorithm
    parameters, `generateKeyPair` callbacks, and broad `generatePrimeSync`
    overloads are now specialized or pruned.
  - Current `node:crypto` metrics: `JSValue refs = 0`, `JSValue functions = 0`,
    `JSValue surface = 0`.
- [x] Hono practical route API smoke.
  - The real-world smoke now writes a route as
    `app.hono_get("/", realworld_hono_handler)`.
  - Route paths lower to `String`, handlers lower to `(Context) -> Response`,
    and common `Context` response helpers such as `text` return `Response`.
  - Current Hono budget is tightened to 55 `JSValue` surface lines and 36
    `JSValue` functions; remaining fallbacks are mostly generic context,
    router, and validation data surfaces.
- [x] Zod / Valibot / Preact fallback policy documented.
  - These packages remain buildable and smoke-tested, but their high-order
    schema, parser, JSX, and component generic surfaces are explicitly
    documented as budgeted `JSValue` fallback areas rather than natural MoonBit
    APIs.
- [x] Split real-world packages into explicit fallback policy classes.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` now appends a fallback policy table to
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md` and fails if a new corpus package
    is not classified.
  - Active naturalization targets: Hono, React Router, JOSE, Glob, `date-fns`,
    `magic-string`, `source-map`, `node:sqlite`, `node:fs`, `node:assert`, and
    `node:util`.
  - Budgeted fallback probes: Zod, Valibot, Preact, and broad Playwright
    event/callback surfaces. These should stay buildable and smoke-tested, but
    are not currently claimed as naturally typed MoonBit APIs.
- [x] Add a first Glob naturalization for function-valued const exports.
  - `declare const hasMagic: (pattern: string | string[], options:
    GlobOptions) => boolean` now keeps the existing getter but also emits a
    MoonBit string-subset wrapper as `has_magic(pattern : String, options :
    GlobOptions) -> Bool`.
  - Function-valued const exports whose signatures do not widen to `@js.Any`
    also get direct callable wrappers, so `escape(pattern, options)` and
    `unescape(pattern, options)` no longer require `get_escape()` /
    `get_unescape()` first.
  - The real-world Glob smoke now calls `escape`, `unescape`, and
    `has_magic("src/*.mbt", options)` directly instead of manufacturing a
    `JSValue` pattern argument or calling getter-returned functions.
  - The Hono real-world example smoke now uses a typed MoonBit route handler
    `(Context) -> Response` directly with `app.get("/hello", handler)`.

### Phase 1: Measurement and Diagnostics (60% -> 65%)

- [x] Add a persistent quality score report for bridge generation.
  - Include generated lines, exported declarations, unsupported exports,
    `JSValue` refs, `JSValue` functions, runtime smoke coverage, and diagnostics.
  - Initial fixture-backed report is generated by `just bridge-quality` at
    `_build/bridge-quality/REPORT.md`.
- [x] Split `JSValue` metrics by cause:
  - unknown / any
  - overload fallback
  - conditional / mapped type fallback
  - callback / function type fallback
  - tuple / array fallback
  - namespace / value fallback
  - Initial breakdown is heuristic over generated `bridge.mbti` surface lines
    in `just bridge-quality`.
  - Real-world TypeScript verification uses the same buckets in
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md` and fails on unbudgeted growth.
- [x] Make `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md` explain what was widened, omitted, or
  bridge-wrapped, and whether each item is runtime-safe.
  - Diagnostics now include a summary table with decision, reason, runtime
    safety, and a decision vocabulary for widened / omitted / bridge-wrapped
    surfaces.
- [x] Add a `just bridge-quality` task that runs the fixture corpus and prints a
  single summary table.
- [x] Store real-world corpus package versions / paths in one config file so the
  score is reproducible across machines.
  - TypeScript real-world corpus entries now live in
    `corpus/realworld-typescript.tsv`; `scripts/verify_realworld_typescript.sh`
    records that path in `METRICS.md`.

### Phase 2: TypeScript -> MoonBit Surface Coverage (65% -> 72%)

- [x] Harden npm / Node type resolution:
  - [x] package `exports`
  - [x] `types` / `typings`
  - [x] subpath exports
  - [x] `typesVersions`
  - [x] `@types/*` fallback
  - [x] `node:*` built-in modules
  - Resolver tests now cover package fields, exports conditions, wildcard
    exports, subpaths, `typesVersions`, unscoped and scoped `@types` fallback,
    and `node:*` built-in declarations via `@types/node`.
- [x] Improve overload handling.
  - [x] Prefer overloads that can be represented with concrete MoonBit types.
    - Direct local overload resolution now uses the same widening score as the
      final generated binding collapse, so broad `unknown` / `any` signatures no
      longer hide later concrete signatures.
  - [x] Emit multiple safe wrappers when overloads are materially different and
    nameable.
    - Nameable non-preferred signatures now emit stable suffixed wrappers, e.g.
      `makeCounter_number`, while preserving the original runtime export name in
      generated JS FFI glue.
  - [x] Keep a stable fallback rule when overloads collapse to `JSValue`.
    - Equal-score overloads keep declaration order and still collapse to one
      generated binding.
- [x] Expand common utility type lowering:
  - [x] `Pick` over resolvable interfaces and literal keys.
  - [x] `Omit` over resolvable interfaces and literal keys.
  - [x] `Record` as a named opaque JS object boundary.
  - [x] `Exclude` over directly comparable union members.
  - [x] `Extract` over directly comparable union members.
  - [x] `NonNullable` over optional-like unions.
  - [x] simple `ReturnType` / `Parameters` for direct function types.
  - [x] simple alias-position passthrough for resolved concrete utility aliases.
  - [x] local `typeof Class` capture for `InstanceType` /
    `ConstructorParameters` bridge lowering.
- [x] Support the common mapped-type subset needed by real declaration files.
  - [x] Lower `Partial<T>`, `Required<T>`, and `Readonly<T>` over resolvable
    interfaces into named MoonBit option-bag structs.
  - [x] Parse and lower inline mapped object types with literal keys such as
    `{ [K in "a" | "b"]: T }`.
- [x] Support the common conditional-type subset used by React, Hono, Zod, and
  Node declarations.
  - [x] Lower statically decidable `A extends B ? X : Y` when both sides are
    direct primitive / union types.
  - [x] Lower `Awaited<Promise<T>>` / `Awaited<PromiseLike<T>>`.
  - [x] Cover standard conditional utilities already represented as direct
    utility forms: `NonNullable`, `Exclude`, `Extract`, direct `ReturnType`, and
    direct `Parameters`.
  - [x] Preserve or resolve infer-based conditional aliases instead of widening
    them to `JSValue`.
    - [x] Resolve concrete infer patterns such as
      `Promise<string> extends Promise<infer T> ? T : never`.
    - [x] Preserve generic infer aliases that still depend on type parameters.
      - Generic conditional aliases are retained in the AST and resolved when
        applied to concrete type arguments, e.g. `UnwrapPromise<Promise<string>>`.
- [x] Preserve optional and readonly field information where MoonBit can express
  it; otherwise emit diagnostics instead of silent widening.
  - Optional fields are preserved as optional-like MoonBit surface types.
  - Interface `readonly` fields are retained as metadata and emitted as
    declaration / FFI diagnostics because generated MoonBit structs do not
    enforce TypeScript readonly semantics.

### Phase 3: Runtime Bridge Correctness (72% -> 78%)

- [x] Make runtime namespace handling complete for declaration-merge patterns:
  `function x` + `namespace x`, `class X` + `namespace X`, and value namespaces.
  - Declaration-merged namespace fixtures now cover root function/class/value
    exports, runtime namespace member glue, and namespace-local type references
    such as `make.Options` lowering to `MakeOptions` without leaking
    unqualified helper types.
- [x] Strengthen CJS / ESM interop:
  - `export =`
  - `export default`
  - synthetic default imports
  - namespace imports
  - mixed named/default re-exports
  - Generated fixture smokes now cover `.cjs` `export = namespace`
    runtimes through synthetic default import, `node:path` namespace imports,
    relative/parent-relative default exports, bare CJS package default
    functions, and mixed default/named class re-exports.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for async and Promise-returning APIs.
  - `Promise<T>` / `PromiseLike<T>` now lower to `@js.Promise[T]` in
    declaration and FFI generation, and a generated JS-target fixture awaits
    Promise-returning APIs with `.wait()`.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for callback APIs where the callback can be represented
  safely.
  - Callback parameters are currently represented as `JSValue` / `@js.Any`;
    the generated fixture passes required and optional JS callbacks through
    MoonBit, verifies the runtime side effect on the JS target, and covers
    MoonBit `Option` unwrapping to JS `undefined` / raw callback values.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for object option bags with optional fields.
  - Generated fixture smoke now calls a declaration-merged namespace function
    with a runtime-created `MakeOptions` object containing an optional field,
    then checks the JS target bridge through `moon check` and
    `moon test --target js`.
- [x] Add runtime smokes for class instance properties, static properties, and
  static methods.
  - Existing generated fixtures exercise instance getters/setters, mutable
    static properties, readonly static properties, and static factory methods
    across direct and re-exported class bindings.
- [x] Ensure generated `bridge.js` never imports a missing runtime binding
  without a diagnostic.
  - `unique symbol` marker exports, such as `node:assert`'s internal
    `kOptions`, are now treated as non-runtime declarations and are omitted
    from generated JS glue instead of being imported.

### Phase 4: MoonBit -> TypeScript Package Quality (78% -> 84%)

- [x] Improve method / constructor facade generation beyond the current narrow
  safe subset.
  - Facade generation now includes non-generic async constructors and instance
    methods, emits Promise-returning TypeScript declarations, and post-processes
    generated JS so plain async exports return Promises while async+raise exports
    preserve the Result wrapper expected by the declaration contract.
- [x] Define the public rule for traits:
  - Public traits are represented as declaration-only structural TypeScript
    interfaces.
  - Local `impl Trait for Type` relationships are represented in `.d.ts` output
    as `extends Trait` or type intersections where possible.
  - Trait methods are not generated as runtime bridge exports or facade
    functions; omitted runtime members remain visible through autolink
    diagnostics.
- [x] Preserve MoonBit `raise` effects in TypeScript declarations as a documented
  error contract.
  - Top-level and trait method `raise` effects now render as
    `Result<Return, ErrorType>` in generated TypeScript declarations, matching
    the JS backend's result-wrapper runtime shape.
- [x] Improve child-package and subpath export coverage:
  - [x] root exports
  - [x] nested package exports
  - [x] generated `package.json` `exports`
  - [x] matching JS and `.d.ts` paths
  - The counter scaffold fixture now includes `./child/grand`, and
    `verify-scaffolds` imports the generated nested subpath through Node while
    checking matching package metadata and `.d.ts` declarations.
- [x] Add generated source map and package metadata checks to the verification
  rail.
  - `verify-scaffolds` checks generated `package.json` package names, subpath
    exports, runtime JS files, and source map files for the scaffold fixtures.
- [x] Make facade generation deterministic and diff-friendly for review.
  - Glue declarations, `link.js.exports`, generated package `exports`, and
    child-package runtime re-export files are sorted with an explicit ascending
    string comparator instead of relying on source or map iteration order.

### Phase 5: Real-World Corpus Expansion (84% -> 88%)

- [x] Lock a TypeScript corpus that covers different API shapes:
  - small function libraries: `clsx`, `date-fns`
  - class/value libraries: `chalk`, `dotenv`
  - schema libraries: `zod`
  - web libraries: `hono`, `preact`
  - Node built-ins: `node:fs`, `node:sqlite`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`,
    `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, `node:assert`, `node:util`,
    `node:buffer`
  - callback-heavy APIs: `node:fs`, `node:util`
  - Promise-heavy APIs: `execa`
  - CJS / export-assignment style APIs: `source-map`, Node built-ins
  - Current locked probe entries: `clsx`, `chalk`, `dotenv`, `ignore`, `hono`,
    `zod`, `date-fns`, `colorette`, `magic-string`, `source-map`, `valibot`,
    `immer`, `execa`, `preact`, `node:sqlite`, `node:fs`, `node:path`,
    `node:crypto`, `node:os`, `node:url`, `node:querystring`, `node:assert`,
    `node:util`, `node:buffer`.
- [x] Lock a MoonBit corpus that covers:
  - root-only packages
  - child-package exports
  - effectful APIs
  - generic APIs
  - private root types
  - packages with external JS bindings
  - Current checked entries: `mizchi/ast_printer`, `mizchi/js`,
    `mizchi/jsonschema`, `mizchi/markdown`, `mizchi/nom`,
    `mizchi/pixelmatch`, `mizchi/ripple`, `mizchi/semver`, `mizchi/svg`,
    `mizchi/syntree`, `mizchi/tempfile`, `mizchi/threads`, `mizchi/vfs`,
    `mizchi/jwt.mbt`, `mizchi/zlib`.
- [x] Add per-package smoke programs that use meaningful APIs, not only compile
  the generated bridge.
  - The TypeScript real-world corpus now emits package-specific MoonBit smoke
    programs and runs the built JS with Node after `moon build --target js`.
  - The MoonBit real-world corpus now includes package-specific Node smokes for
    representative APIs, including `svg`, `threads`, and `zlib`.
- [x] Keep each real-world failure as a minimized fixture before fixing it.
  - The `node:assert` missing runtime binding failure is covered by
    `unique-symbol-runtime-export-entry.d.ts`.
- [x] Track corpus status in a generated markdown report checked by CI or an
  opt-in verification task.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` writes
    `_build/realworld-typescript/METRICS.md`.
  - `just verify-realworld-moonbit` writes
    `_build/realworld-moonbit/REPORT.md`.

### Phase 6: Productization and Safety (88% -> 90%)

- [x] Define the public CLI contract:
  - [x] `mbt2ts --input mizchi/foo --out dist`
  - [x] `ts2mbt --input npm-package --out dist`
  - [x] `--module-spec` (`ts2mbt` only)
  - [x] `--diagnostics`
  - [x] `--strict`
  - The `tsmbt` binary was split into per-direction `ts2mbt` / `mbt2ts`
    binaries; the `--direction` flag was retired since each binary picks
    its own direction. Unified CLI help, parser tests, and README now
    document the per-binary public contract.
- [x] Add strict mode that fails on any unsupported export or unbudgeted
  `JSValue` fallback.
  - TS -> MoonBit strict mode rejects ambiguous/unsupported export surfaces
    before generation and generated `JSValue` fallback occurrences after
    generation, while writing diagnostics.
  - MoonBit -> TypeScript strict mode rejects omitted autolink members reported
    in `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- [x] Add non-strict mode that always emits a buildable scaffold with diagnostics
  when possible.
  - Unified TS -> MoonBit now always writes `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md` or the
    requested `--diagnostics` path after scaffold generation.
  - Unified MoonBit -> TypeScript continues to write `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`
    and can mirror it to `--diagnostics`.
- [x] Add snapshot tests for generated file layout and package metadata.
  - Unified MoonBit -> TypeScript and TypeScript -> MoonBit tests now assert
    generated file layouts and package metadata for the public CLI path.
- [x] Document supported TypeScript and MoonBit subsets with examples.
  - README now includes supported subset examples for both bridge directions.
- [x] Add a release checklist:
  - [x] fixture CI
  - [x] real-world TypeScript probe
  - [x] real-world MoonBit probe
  - [x] generated docs update
  - [x] changelog entry

### Explicit Non-Goals Before 90%

- [ ] Do not attempt full TypeScript type-checker parity.
- [ ] Do not implement arbitrary TypeScript conditional/mapped type semantics
  unless a real-world target needs the subset.
- [ ] Do not promise arbitrary npm package conversion without diagnostics.
- [ ] Do not hide widened or omitted API surfaces; every fallback must be
  inspectable.

## Parser / Semantics Real-World Gaps

### Current bug
- [x] `emit-moonbit-decl` / `emit-moonbit-js-ffi` should not resolve non-exported opaque type imports.
  - Symptom: an entry like `import { ResultAsync, type Result } from "neverthrow"` crashed when the package actually existed under `/tmp/.../node_modules`.
  - Cause: `load_type_module_graph` eagerly resolved every import specifier even when the imported binding was never exported or re-exported from the entry surface.
  - Fix direction: keep re-exports / exported imports in the graph, but leave plain opaque imports unresolved.

### Remaining work
- [x] Add a stable end-to-end regression harness for the external `/tmp/tsmbt-realworld-check` repro instead of relying on ad-hoc local verification.
  - Covered by the `/tmp/ts_mbt_neverthrow_like_*` regression tests in `src/main_wbtest.mbt`, which exercise `emit_moonbit_decl_text` / `emit_moonbit_js_ffi_texts` against a pnpm-style temp project layout.
- [x] Minimize a fixture from the actual `neverthrow` package if more parser coverage is needed beyond the graph-resolution fix.
  - Covered by `fixtures/resolver/project/types/neverthrow-like-entry.d.ts` plus the pnpm-style `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/neverthrow-like` fixture, and exercised through decl / JS FFI / scaffold generation.

## MoonBit / TypeScript Package Bridge Plan

Generate TypeScript-consumable bridge artifacts from MoonBit package interfaces without hand-writing `link.js.exports`, and keep the reverse `TS -> MoonBit` path aligned around the same surface model.

### Batch 1: MBTI autolink bootstrap

- [x] Emit `link.js.exports` JSON config from `.mbti` top-level public free functions.
- [x] Exclude methods / constructors / trait methods from the generated JS export surface.
- [x] Add CLI coverage so the generated config can be written directly from `pkg.generated.mbti`.

### Next batches

- [x] Add a recursive `.mbti` resolver so generated `.d.ts` imports can be rewritten to generated sibling packages instead of raw MoonBit package specifiers.
- [x] Add a high-level `MoonBit -> TS package scaffold` command that generates temporary autolink glue, runs `moon build --target js`, and emits a JS-backed `.d.ts` package.
- [x] Align the reverse `TS -> MoonBit bridge package` flow on the same top-level export surface model and resolver assumptions.

## Bridge / Scaffold Operational Hardening

### P0

- [x] Harden unsupported export handling in `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts`.
  - Namespace exports are supported as opaque getters, and ambiguous re-exports no longer block scaffold generation; they are widened/omitted consistently with the low-level emitters and reported in `SCAFFOLD_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.
- [x] Add `just verify-scaffolds` and wire it into `just ci`.
  - Acceptance: `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` produces build-backed `index.js`, is compiled with `tsc`, and is smoke-tested through Node import; `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts` is compiled/tested with `moon check/test --target js`.
- [x] Add external import rewrite mapping for `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti`.
  - `emit-typescript-package-from-mbti` / `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` now accept an optional JSON rewrite map and apply it before writing external `.d.ts` imports.

### P1

- [x] Generate publish-ready metadata for `MoonBit -> TS` scaffold output.
  - `emit-typescript-scaffold-from-mbti` now writes `package.json` with `name`, `type`, `types`, `import`, and per-subpath `exports.types` entries alongside build-backed `index.js` / `.d.ts` files. Temporary `moon.pkg.json` glue is created only inside the source module and removed after `moon build --target js`.
- [x] Decide how to handle methods / static members omitted from `link.js.exports`.
  - The default scaffold still emits `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md` so omissions are explicit, strips runtime-inaccessible method declarations from package `.d.ts`, and `emit-typescript-facade-scaffold-from-mbti` now provides an opt-in wrapper path for root-package local non-generic methods / constructors.

### P2

- [x] Minimize a stable real-world fixture from `neverthrow` if broader package-surface coverage is still needed.
  - `just verify-scaffolds` now exercises the stable `neverthrow-like` fixture end-to-end, including generated MoonBit scaffold compile/test under JS.

### P3

- [x] Revisit broader `namespace export` support after the scaffold path is stable.
  - `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts` now accepts namespace exports and exposes them as opaque getter functions in the generated package. Ambiguous re-exports are emitted conservatively and surfaced in scaffold diagnostics instead of failing fast.

## TS Bridge Constraints

- [x] Prefer direct `#module("...")` imports when the runtime `moduleSpec` is non-relative.
  - Works for bare specifiers, `node:*`, and rooted specifiers like `/src/api/client.ts`.
  - This now covers top-level function exports, instance methods/properties, and class constructors.
  - Bare package `default` function exports are intentionally routed through
    `bridge.js`; this avoids MoonBit JS backend default binding mismatches for
    CJS packages such as `express`.
- [x] Keep `bridge.js` fallback for relative module specs like `./client.js` and `../client.js`.
  - MoonBit currently rejects relative paths in `#module("...")`.
- [x] Keep wrappers for static members / value exports / namespace exports for now.
  - `= "Counter.from"` / `= "Counter.version"` style dotted import names compile poorly in the current JS backend.
  - `#module(...)` combined with inline `#|` JS also does not lower correctly for imported module bindings in the current backend.

## TS Enum / Literal Union Design

Goal: represent the safe TypeScript enum-like subset as MoonBit `enum` without
lying at the JS boundary. The generated public MoonBit API should be pleasant to
use, while the generated bridge must still pass the exact primitive values that
TypeScript runtimes expect.

### Scope

- [x] Support named string literal unions as closed MoonBit enums:
  - `type Variant = "primary" | "secondary"` ->
    `pub(all) enum Variant { Primary; Secondary }`.
  - Optional unions preserve optionality:
    `"primary" | "secondary" | undefined` -> `Variant?`.
  - Direct anonymous literal unions on exported fields / params / returns now
    receive stable synthetic names such as `ButtonOptionsVariant` and
    `RenderButtonReturn`.
- [x] Support boolean literal unions only when they are not just `boolean`:
  - `true | false` remains `Bool`.
  - `true | undefined` remains `Bool?`.
  - Named boolean literal aliases now resolve through primitive `Bool` /
    `Bool?` bridge signatures instead of emitting enum wrappers.
- [x] Support numeric literal unions only when every member is an integer-like
  literal and the runtime bridge can convert losslessly.
  - [x] Named numeric literal union aliases lower to closed MoonBit enums and
    bridge through raw `Int` params / returns.
  - [x] Direct anonymous numeric literal unions use the same synthetic naming
    pass and bridge through raw `Int` params / returns.
- [x] Support ambient / declaration enum surfaces:
  - `declare enum Mode { Read = "read" }`
  - `declare const enum Mode { Read = "read" }`
  - implicit numeric members are allowed only when all previous values can be
    evaluated statically.
  - [x] Parser preserves `declare enum` / `declare const enum` in `TsModule`,
    including declared namespaces, and bridge package output now exposes those
    enums in both `bridge.mbt` and `bridge.mbti`.
  - [x] Raw extern wrappers keep string enums primitive and expose public
    MoonBit enum wrappers for params and returns.
  - [x] Optional string enum params / returns use `Variant?` conversion and
    keep JS `undefined` behavior.
  - [x] Raw extern wrappers keep statically evaluable numeric enums as `Int`
    and expose public MoonBit enum wrappers for params and returns, including
    optional `Variant?` conversion.
- [x] Defer heterogeneous enum unions and non-literal computed enum values to
  the existing primitive / `JSValue` fallback with diagnostics.

### Internal Model

- [x] Replace or extend the current `TsType::Literal(String)` representation.
  - Current parser stores string `"1"` and numeric `1` both as `Literal("1")`,
    which is not precise enough for bridge conversion.
  - Add a typed literal model, e.g. `TsLiteralValue::{String, Number, BigInt,
    Bool}`, and keep helper functions so existing `keyof` / object-key logic
    can continue treating string keys uniformly.
  - `TsType` now keeps string literal/object keys as `Literal(String)` while
    preserving non-string literal types as `NumberLiteral`, `BigIntLiteral`,
    and `BooleanLiteral`.
- [x] Add AST nodes for enum declarations:
  - `TsEnumDecl { name, members, is_const, is_declare }`
  - `TsEnumMember { name, value : TsLiteralValue? }`
  - Store them in `TsModule` and `TsModuleBlock`, parallel to interfaces and
    type aliases.
  - [x] Added `TsEnumDecl`, `TsEnumMember`, and `TsEnumMemberValue` to
    `TsModule`; module-block export collection now recognizes
    `export declare enum` for bridge export surfaces.
  - [x] `TsEnumMember.is_computed` now distinguishes implicit numeric enum
    members from non-literal computed initializers.
  - [x] `TsModuleBlock` still needs a first-class enum array if script-level
    enum declarations need to be preserved beyond export metadata.
- [x] Normalize type aliases that are pure string literal unions into an enum-lowering
  candidate before `emit_moonbit_decl` / `emit_moonbit_js_ffi` renders types.
  - Keep the original alias name as the MoonBit enum name.
  - If the alias is anonymous inside a parameter or field, keep the current
    primitive fallback until a stable synthetic naming rule is needed.

### MoonBit Surface

- [x] Emit public enum declarations in both `bridge.mbt` and `bridge.mbti`.
  - This must mirror the recent struct rule: generated implementation and
    interface files expose the same public shape.
  - [x] Ambient enum exports are emitted as `pub(all) enum` in both package
    implementation and interface output.
  - [x] Runtime TypeScript `export enum` declarations are preserved through
    `TsModuleBlock` export discovery and emitted in package bridge output.
- [x] Generate stable constructor names:
  - sanitize to PascalCase;
  - suffix MoonBit keywords;
  - disambiguate collisions deterministically;
  - preserve the original TS literal in generated conversion helpers.
- [x] Keep raw externs primitive and wrap them for string enums:
  - Params: public function accepts `Variant`, private/raw extern accepts
    `String`.
  - Returns: raw extern returns primitive, public wrapper converts to
    `Variant`.
  - Optional params / returns use `Variant?` wrappers and keep JS `undefined`
    behavior through generated optional conversion helpers.

Example target shape:

```moonbit
pub(all) enum ButtonVariant {
  Primary
  Secondary
} derive(Eq, Debug)

fn ButtonVariant::to_js(self : ButtonVariant) -> String {
  match self {
    Primary => "primary"
    Secondary => "secondary"
  }
}

fn button_variant_from_js(value : String) -> ButtonVariant {
  match value {
    "primary" => Primary
    "secondary" => Secondary
    _ => abort("unexpected ButtonVariant value")
  }
}

extern "js" fn render_button_raw(variant : String) -> Unit = "__ts_mbt_render_button"

pub fn renderButton(variant : ButtonVariant) -> Unit {
  render_button_raw(variant.to_js())
}
```

### JS Bridge Rules

- [x] Do not pass MoonBit enum runtime objects directly to JS APIs for string
  enums.
  - MoonBit JS backend enums are tagged values; TypeScript libraries expect the
    primitive literal value.
- [x] Prefer MoonBit-side conversion wrappers over JS-side enum construction.
  - JS bridge code cannot reliably construct MoonBit enum values unless those
    constructors are exported by the compiled MoonBit package.
  - Return conversion should therefore happen in generated MoonBit wrapper
    code from raw primitive externs.
- [x] Reuse the existing optional object-field converter only after enum values
  have been converted to primitives.

### Diagnostics and Safety

- [x] Add diagnostics for every enum-like surface that is not lowered:
  - [x] mixed string/number enum;
  - [x] computed enum member;
  - [x] duplicate literal values after sanitization;
  - [x] mixed / non-integer / bigint named literal-union aliases;
  - [x] anonymous literal union without a stable public name.
- [x] Keep strict mode behavior unchanged: unsupported enum lowering in a
  public surface must either fall back within budget or fail with an actionable
  diagnostic.
- [x] Add real-world probes after fixtures pass:
  - [x] Node string modes / flags;
  - [x] React string literal props;
  - [x] Hono option modes;
  - [x] TypeScript AST `SyntaxKind`-style numeric enum as an `Int` bridge
    stress case.

### TDD Order

- [x] Red: parser tests for string/numeric/const enum declarations and typed
  literal unions.
- [x] Green: AST + parser support without bridge lowering.
- [x] Red: declaration generation tests for named literal-union aliases.
- [x] Green: emit MoonBit enum declarations in `.mbt` / `.mbti`.
- [x] Red: JS-target smoke where a MoonBit enum argument reaches a TS function
  expecting a string literal.
  - `fixtures/bridge_smoke/enum-entry.d.ts` verifies generated code passes
    primitive string enum values through `moon check --target js` and
    `moon test --target js`.
- [x] Green: raw extern + public wrapper conversion for params.
- [x] Red: JS-target smoke where a TS function returns a literal union and
  MoonBit pattern matches the result.
  - Named string literal union aliases are covered by
    `fixtures/bridge_smoke/literal-union-alias-entry.d.ts`.
- [x] Green: primitive return conversion with an explicit unexpected-value
  abort path.
- [x] Refactor: share enum metadata between decl, FFI, and package bridge
  emitters so literal-union and `declare enum` use the same lowering path.
  - [x] Share ambient enum case/value/unsupported-reason lowering between
    declaration diagnostics and FFI generation.
  - [x] Share literal-union alias enum declaration lowering through
    `enum_lowering_type_alias_enum_decl`.

## Normalized DTS Shape-Merge Scope

- [x] Keep object-shape compatibility checks inside `src/bridge/object_shape_merge.mbt`.
  - The helper exists to support `normalize-moonbit-dts`, not to become a full TypeScript checker.
- [x] Keep the shape-merge scope narrow.
  - Current responsibility: decide whether object-like interface expansions can be flattened safely, or should fall back to intersections.
  - Current coverage: duplicate properties, `readonly`, optional-property keys, and "do not merge methods / overload-like members".
- [x] Avoid growing the bridge normalization helper into a full semantic checker unless a separate goal is explicitly chosen.
  - If future work needs real TS semantics, define that as a separate milestone instead of quietly expanding the normalization helper.

## Bridge Const-Table Batch Plan

Reduce the need to pick one edge case at a time by shipping the next `default export const table` batch together and keeping the smoke rail in sync.

### Batch scope

- [x] `import * as tables from "./x"` where `x` exports a const table.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` re-exports a named `const TABLES`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` directly `export default { ... }`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default { ... } as const`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => ({ ... }))()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => { const ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (function() { const ...; return TABLES })()`.

### Acceptance rail

- [x] Add parser regression proving exported const-value collection for each new default-export shape.
- [x] Add decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for each new shape.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures so `just verify-generated-fixtures` and `just ci` execute the generated package under JS.

### Next batch: IIFE local let handling

- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (() => { let ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` does `export default (function() { let ...; return TABLES })()`.
- [x] Keep local `let` mutation conservative: if the returned table depends on reassigned locals, widen instead of resolving statically.
- [x] Add parser / decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for the `let` cases.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures for positive `let` cases and the conservative widened case.

### Next batch: IIFE local mutation conservative handling

- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` mutates `KEYS.nested` before returning the table.
- [x] `import tables from "./x"` where `x` mutates `INDEXES[0]` before returning the table.
- [x] Keep local property/index mutation conservative even when the final runtime value is unchanged.
- [x] Add parser / decl / JS FFI / bridge-package regressions for the mutation cases.
- [x] Add bridge smoke fixtures for the conservative widened mutation cases.

## React / JSX Real-World Support

Keep pushing real package support through `.d.ts` surface parsing and scaffold generation before adding a full JSX expression parser.

### Current status

- [x] Accept `export as namespace ...` without crashing `emit-moonbit-scaffold-from-ts`.
- [x] Flatten `export = React; declare namespace React { ... }` style surfaces into top-level scaffold exports.
- [x] Surface nested `JSX` namespace types from `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, and `react/jsx-dev-runtime`.
- [x] Normalize the first round of React utility types:
  - `PropsWithChildren<T>`
  - `ComponentProps<"tag">`
  - `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"tag">`
  - `ComponentPropsWithRef<"tag">`
  - nested `PropsWithChildren<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<...>>`
- [x] Convert known React hook tuple returns into named synthetic result types.
- [x] Preserve optional React-style props/params as `T?` instead of widening everything to `JSValue`.
- [x] Make generated MoonBit identifiers safe for reserved words and dotted ambient names.

### Next work

- [x] Reduce widening around React overload-heavy APIs.
  - Priority targets: `createElement`, `cloneElement`, `forwardRef`, `memo`.
  - [x] Lower `keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements` parameters to `String` for `createElement` / JSX runtime entrypoints instead of `JSValue`.
- [x] Model exotic/callable component surfaces more explicitly.
  - Priority targets: `FunctionComponent`, `ForwardRefExoticComponent`, `MemoExoticComponent`, `NamedExoticComponent`.
  - Callable React component surfaces are emitted as opaque external JS callable types in FFI output instead of fake record structs with `<call>` fields.
- [x] Improve utility/conditional type lowering beyond the first pass.
  - Priority targets: `ReactNode`, `ComponentRef`, `ElementRef`, `LibraryManagedAttributes`, `RefAttributes`.
  - `Partial<T>` / `Readonly<T>` pass through to `T`; `LibraryManagedAttributes<C, P>` lowers to `P`; `ComponentRef<T>` / `ElementRef<T>` lower to `Ref`; `ReactNode` lowers to `JSValue` / `@js.Any` at the generated bridge boundary.
- [x] Add stable end-to-end verification for generated React scaffolds under `moon check/test --target js`.
  - `just verify-scaffolds` now checks React-like JSX, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, and the Hono options fixture with generated packages under the JS target. The React cases use a local `mizchi/js/core` stub instead of depending on a separate checkout.
- [x] Add stable fixture coverage for `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`, `react/jsx-dev-runtime`, and `hono/jsx`.
  - Keep real-world probe findings as minimized fixtures instead of ad-hoc `/tmp` checks.
  - Minimized package fixtures live under `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/react` and `fixtures/resolver/project/node_modules/hono`; `just verify-scaffolds` now compiles/tests generated MoonBit packages against those package names.
- [x] Keep JSX parser work deferred until `.d.ts` type-surface parsing is no longer the blocker.
  - Re-evaluate only if React/Hono support hits syntax that cannot be represented from declaration files alone.

## Real-World MoonBit Package Probe

- [x] Support `tsmbt --input mizchi/foo --out dist/` style ghq package resolution for MoonBit packages.
- [x] Verify build-backed `MoonBit -> TypeScript` scaffold generation through `moon build --target js` for local `mizchi/ripple`, `mizchi/semver`, and `mizchi/tempfile` checkouts.
  - `just verify-realworld-moonbit` is optional and skipped package-by-package when those local ghq checkouts are absent.
- [x] Broaden the local real-world probe set to `mizchi/ast_printer`, `mizchi/js`, `mizchi/jsonschema`, `mizchi/markdown`, `mizchi/nom`, `mizchi/pixelmatch`, `mizchi/syntree`, `mizchi/tui`, `mizchi/vfs`, and `mizchi/jwt.mbt`.
- [x] Resolve ghq packages whose repository name differs from their MoonBit module name by reading `moon.mod.json` metadata.
- [x] Preserve MoonBit `raise` effects in temporary glue wrappers so effectful packages such as `mizchi/semver` build.
- [x] Skip facade wrappers that would expose private root types from the source package; the generated `.d.ts` can still document those opaque types, but glue packages cannot refer to private MoonBit symbols.
- [x] Qualify local root trait bounds in temporary glue wrappers so generic packages such as `mizchi/nom` build.
- [x] Emit child-package runtime re-export files and facade declarations so recursive MoonBit -> TypeScript packages expose matching `.d.ts` and JS subpaths.
- [x] Add stable real-world MBTI declaration snapshots for `mizchi/ast_printer` and `mizchi/jsonschema` to default fixture typechecking.
- [x] Re-run the local real-world MoonBit probe and confirm the current package set passes generated JS import and declaration typecheck.
- [x] Investigate packages that fail before or during source JS build for reasons outside the generated glue surface.
  - `mizchi/ast_printer` was fixed by updating its `moonbitlang/parser` dependency from `0.1.15` to `0.2.5` and adapting the printer to the current parser AST (`type P = Point` aliases, no removed top-level alias constructors, `TypeDesc::Record(fields~, ..)`).

## CI Notes

- Default `just ci` remains fixture-based and does not require local ghq checkouts.
- `just verify-realworld-moonbit` is intentionally outside default CI because it probes developer-local MoonBit repositories and writes temporary glue packages into those source modules during `moon build --target js`.
- `just verify-realworld-typescript` is intentionally outside default CI because it probes a developer-local npm package corpus via `TSMBT_REALWORLD_TYPESCRIPT_NODE_MODULES`.

## Beyond 90%: Bridge Quality Gaps for Tier 2 / Tier 3 Packages (2026-05-03)

After the 90% gate, the remaining `naturalize-target` and `budgeted-fallback`
JSValue surfaces are dominated by a small set of structural limitations rather
than ad-hoc fixes. The previous demand-driven plateau was reached at hono = 50,
date-fns = 22, jose = 84, react-router = 194, etc., where each remaining
fallback traces to one of the items below. Each item is a multi-commit
structural change, not a one-off lowering tweak.

Priority is by impact on real-world bridge JSValue surface, not by ease.

### 1. Heterogeneous union -> auto-enum (highest ROI, bridge-local)

Patterns: `number | string | Date` (jose setters), `(string | number)[]` (immer
Patch.path), `string | string[]`, `boolean | "boundary"` (magic-string hires),
`boolean | OverwriteOptions` (magic-string), schema-leaf branches in zod /
valibot.

- [x] Detect heterogeneous unions whose members can each be discriminated at
  runtime (`typeof` for primitives, `instanceof` for known classes, optional
  fallback for plain objects).
- [x] Lower the alias / synthetic-named union into a `pub(all) enum` with one
  case per member, where each case wraps the lowered MoonBit type (e.g.
  `Number(Double) | StringValue(String) | DateValue(Date)`).
- [x] Generate paired conversion helpers: MoonBit-side `to_js(self) -> JSValue`
  using primitive coercions, and JS-side discrimination wrappers in
  `bridge.js`.
- [x] Reuse the existing literal-union synthetic naming pass for anonymous
  heterogeneous unions on params / fields / return types.
  - Mixed primitive + string/number/bigint/boolean literal unions now lower
    too: literal cases become no-payload enum constructors (e.g. `Boundary`)
    discriminated via `=== "boundary"`. Pure literal unions still defer to
    `enum_lowering`, and a literal whose primitive type collides with a
    non-literal sibling stays on JSValue.
- [x] Auto-wrap return values to the MoonBit-side `<alias>_from_js`
  representation when the discriminator is purely typeof / isArray / strict
  equality. Tagged-union aliases that depend on `instanceof <NamedClass>`
  (e.g. `ServerType = Server | Http2Server | Http2SecureServer` from
  `node:net` / `node:http2`) are skipped because the named classes aren't
  reachable from `bridge.js`.
- [x] Emit diagnostics and stay on JSValue when discrimination is ambiguous
  (e.g. two struct members with overlapping shapes).
  - `tagged_union_widen_reason_for_alias` reports the rejection cause
    (overlapping primitive discriminator, non-PascalCase / non-discriminable
    member, or duplicate constructor name) and the resolution chain in
    `moonbit_decl.mbt` surfaces it as a `Unsupported export <Name>: ...`
    comment in the generated `bridge.mbti`. Pure-literal unions still
    defer silently to `enum_lowering`, and `null` / `undefined` markers
    are filtered out before evaluating discrimination so plain optional
    widening doesn't get diagnosed.
- [x] Add real-world budgets: jose, magic-string, immer, and zod / valibot
  schema leaves where applicable.
  - `just verify-realworld-typescript` is back to a green baseline across
    all 24 corpus entries; per-package `JSValue` cause budgets, function
    counts, and unsupported-export budgets now reflect the actual
    generated output, including the new heterogeneous-union diagnostics.
- [x] Drive the `heterogeneous-union-widened` budget back to 0 (done
  2026-07-15, same day it was added). Four lowerings landed:
  - qualified namespace refs resolve to their flattened export name
    before classification (`JSX.Element` -> `JsxElement`, hono `Child`);
  - function members discriminate via `typeof === "function"` and render
    as arrow payloads (`FnValue(() -> String)` — drizzle `NeonAuthToken`,
    react `ElementType`); inline `Auto_*` synthesis still excludes
    function members (the useState wrapper glue can't produce the enum);
  - branded-string intersections collapse to `string` and the
    LiteralUnion pattern collapses to a plain String alias
    (vitest `CancelReason = "a" | "b" | (string & Record<string, never>)`);
  - indexed access over an EMPTY registry interface reduces to `never`
    and drops from the union (vitest
    `TestArtifact = A | B | C | Registry[keyof Registry]`).

### 2. Method-level generics preserved through bridge

Patterns: `Hono<E,S,P>.get<Path extends string>(path: Path, handler):
Hono<E, S, P | Path>`, `Session.get<Key extends keyof Data>(key: Key)`,
`zod.object<T extends ZodRawShape>(shape: T)`.

- [x] Capture method-level type parameter lists (and bounds) on
  `TsClassMethodDecl`. (commit `eeb94a6`)
- Investigation result (2026-05-03): bound substitution at method
  boundaries is **already happening** in `parser_type.mbt:639`
  (`local_type_param_bound`), which short-circuits any `Ident(name)`
  to its registered bound during type parsing. Methods like
  `HonoRequest.valid<T extends keyof ValidationTargets>(target: T)`
  already render as `valid(target : String) -> ...` because `T` is
  substituted away before the AST escapes the parser.
- MoonBit JS backend rejects `pub extern "js" fn[T] ...`
  (`Error 4008: FFI function cannot have type parameters`), so a
  generic-preserving public signature would require a separate
  wrapper layer (`pub fn[T] Class::method(...) { Class::method_raw(...) }`).
  This only buys typing precision when the bound is itself
  representable as a MoonBit trait, which is rare for the
  string-literal / interface bounds used in real corpora.
- [x] Conclusion: keep the AST fields populated so a later
  wrapper-layer pass can use them, but do not generate a separate
  generic surface yet. The bound-substitute path covers the common
  cases. Revisit only when a real-world consumer needs a generic
  return type that is not represented by the substituted bound.

### 3. Mapped type partial evaluation + conditional reduction depth

Patterns: zod `output<T>` / `infer<T>` mapped types, valibot equivalent,
date-fns `EachDayOfIntervalResult<I, O>` (Array<conditional + infer + indexed
access>), jose key-typed builders.

- [x] Extend `simplify_type` so distributive conditional types reduce when each
  branch resolves to the same concrete shape after bound substitution and
  infer extraction. (Done via the `Union` source path in `simplify_type` —
  every leaf must resolve definitively; otherwise the conditional is
  preserved for a later retry.)
- [~] Branch-join over `Array<Conditional<...>>`: the simplifier reduces a
  union of conditionals when every branch decides, but doesn't yet
  collect leaf branches and accept the join when only the terminal-default
  shape matches. Low real-world ROI; left for later.
- [x] Lower mapped types with key remapping (`{ [K in keyof T as ...]: ... }`)
  for the common output-shape pattern used by zod / valibot. (Implemented
  via `MappedTypeRemap` + `simplify_mapped_type_remap`.)
- [x] Treat unresolvable infer patterns as their bound rather than `JSValue` so
  generic `infer DateType extends Date` collapses to `Date` at the bridge
  boundary. (`moonbit_decl.mbt` / `moonbit_js_ffi.mbt` consult
  `infer_marker_bound` at the surface boundary;
  `match_infer_pattern` now also rejects sources definitively disjoint
  from the bound at match time.)

### 4. Template literal types

Patterns: node:util `InspectColorBackground = bg${Capitalize<InspectColorForeground>}`,
react-router path patterns, zod template-literal validators.

- [x] Add AST nodes for template literal types (`TsType::TemplateLiteralType`)
  including `Capitalize` / `Lowercase` / `Uppercase` / `Uncapitalize` intrinsic
  string-mapping types.
- [x] Resolve template literal types to a string-literal union when the
  parameter is a finite string-literal union. (`simplify_template_literal`
  cartesian-products the part / arg pairs.)
- [x] Reuse the existing string-literal-union enum-lowering path for template
  literal types whose parameter union is small and safely PascalCase-able.
  (Bridge enum lowering walks the template result.)
- [x] Otherwise fall back to `String` rather than `JSValue` when the template
  shape is statically known to produce strings.
  (`TemplateLiteralType(_, _) => "String"` in both decl / FFI renderers.)

### 5. JSX / component layer

Patterns: preact / react-router component definitions, `FunctionComponent<P>`,
`ForwardRefExoticComponent`, JSX intrinsic elements.

- [~] Open design decision: a JSX-aware bridge layer ships as MoonBit-native
  types in the existing bridge. No separate generator output is planned.
- [x] Preserve `FunctionComponent<P>` as a callable opaque whose props are
  represented as the resolved `P` struct. (Done via the React-specific
  utility lowering pass; callable component surfaces are emitted as opaque
  external JS callable types.)
- [~] Lower `JSX.Element` to a JS-opaque type that round-trips through bridge
  glue without widening to `JSValue` for every render call. Current state
  collapses `JSX.Element` to `@js.Any` at the bridge boundary; a dedicated
  opaque type per JSX namespace is still open.
- [~] Re-evaluate preact / react-router naturalize budgets after JSX layer.
  Budgets updated as needed when the bridge realigns; no fresh pass is
  scheduled.

### 6. Class static-side / index signature / module augmentation

Patterns: jose builder pattern (`new SignJWT(payload).setIssuedAt()...`),
magic-string `MagicString` static helpers, hono `c.set()` per-context
augmentation, React `HTMLAttributes` index signatures.

- [x] Class static-side (`typeof Class`) merging: `PropAccess` on a class
  identifier consults `globals[Name.member]` (which catches namespace + class
  declaration merging) and the class's static methods / properties before
  falling back to instance-side lookup.
- [x] Lower `[key: string]: V` index signatures: `TsClassDecl.index_signatures`
  carries the parsed entries and `lookup_class_field` falls through to
  `index_signature_value` after exhausting named members. The
  `TsInterface` side already worked.
- [x] Module augmentation graph: `TsModule.module_augmentations :
  Array[(String, TsModule)]` records every `declare module "X" { ... }`
  block by specifier; declarations still flow into the surrounding scope
  for legacy consumers.

### 7. Modern syntax follow-ups (smaller)

- [x] `satisfies` operator at the expression level. (Parser retains
  `Satisfies(expr, ty)`; checker validates assignment in
  `check_call_args_in_expr`.)
- [x] Stage-3 decorators on classes. (`TsClassDecl.decorators` retains the
  parsed `@expr` chain.)
- [x] `using` / `await using` declarations including `export using` at the
  module export position.
- [x] Const generics (`<const T>`). Retained on `TsFunc.const_type_params`
  and consulted by the JSX generic-component inference path to skip
  literal widening when any of the component's type parameters carries
  the modifier.

### 8. Polymorphic `this` keeps fluent chains typed (done 2026-07-15)

Patterns: zod `ZodType.check(...): this` / `optional(): ZodOptional<this>`,
builder chains like jose `SignJWT.setIssuedAt(): this`, generic classes
with `merge(other: this): this`.

- [x] `this` in interface members and class methods now lowers to the
  owning declaration applied to its own type parameters
  (`Schema[Output, Input, Internals]`) instead of `Named(owner)` +
  the `JSValue` arity filler (`Schema[JSValue, JSValue, JSValue]`).
  The substitution is root-scoped: members merged in from `extends`
  expansion also resolve `this` to the derived struct, matching TS
  semantics and keeping every substituted param in scope.
  Implemented in `decl_this_owner_type` / `decl_replace_this_type`
  (now recursing through `Func` params and returns as well, so
  `apply((this) => R)`-style callback params stop leaking a raw
  `This` opaque type). zod: SCAFFOLD JSValue fallback entries
  748 -> 648; the whole fluent core (`check` / `clone` / `optional` /
  `nullable` / `describe` / ...) keeps `Schema[Output, Input, Internals]`.

### 9. Generic free functions export via monomorphized glue (done 2026-07-15)

Previously every `pub fn[T] ...` free function was omitted from
`link.js.exports` and listed in `AUTOLINK_DIAGNOSTICS.md`.

- [x] Unconstrained generic free functions now export through autolink
  glue: type parameters are instantiated at an opaque
  `#external pub type TsMbtGenericAny` (values cross the JS boundary
  unchanged, which is exactly parametric behavior), the glue wrapper is
  therefore non-generic and exportable, and the emitted `.d.ts` keeps the
  original generic signature (`export function identity<T>(value: T): T`).
- [x] Bare `T?` returns unwrap to `value | undefined` via a
  `tsmbt_generic_undefined()` extern, because `Option[TsMbtGenericAny]`
  crosses the boundary in the boxed `{_0}` representation.
- [x] Eligibility is decided by `mbti_generic_glue_return_plan` and shared
  by the glue emitter, the runtime-inaccessible screening, and the
  diagnostics list. Ineligible (stay omitted): trait bounds (`[T : Show]`),
  type params inside tuples (MoonBit tuples are not JS arrays), type params
  under `Option` anywhere except the bare top-level return, and optional
  params (`name? : T`).
- Runtime verified with a node smoke: `identity(obj) === obj`,
  `identity(undefined) === undefined`, `first([]) === undefined`,
  `first([10, 20]) === 10`; `tsc --strict` accepts a typed generic consumer
  of the emitted `.d.ts`.
- Next increments: generic methods on non-generic owners (same
  monomorphization through the facade path), then generic owners.

### 10. String-subset boundary for optional-message unions (done 2026-07-15)

Pattern: zod's check surface passes `params?: string | $ZodCheckMinLengthParams`
on nearly every validator (`min`, `max`, `length`, `regex`, ...). The
`$`-prefixed name cannot become a tagged-union constructor (names must start
`A-Z`), so the whole param degraded to `JSValue?`.

- [x] `ffi_string_subset_union_text`: a two-member union pairing `string`
  with a named `*Params` bag that is NOT a declared type on the bridge
  surface now types the boundary as `String`. The common string form is
  naturally typed; the structured object form stays reachable via
  `unsafeCast`. Guards: exactly two members, `Params` suffix required,
  abstains when the named type is declared / a generic param / a local type
  param — so option-bag unions with reachable declarations keep their
  tagged lowering and `string | URL` keeps the JSValue fallback.
- zod: SCAFFOLD JSValue fallback entries 648 -> 565
  (`min : (Double, String?) -> ZodMap[Key, Value]` etc.); the regenerated
  zod3 package passes `moon check --target js`.
- Note: per-package JSValue counts in the env-gated realworld METRICS
  corpus may drift downward next time it is regenerated — the budget file
  encodes upper bounds, so this is safe, but expect diffs there.

### 11. zod fallback batch 2: decl-path subset, hidden members, bounds, lib prelude, predicate folding (done 2026-07-15)

Five lowerings driven by the remaining zod JSValue-fallback clusters. zod
SCAFFOLD fallback entries: 565 -> 241 (and the entries that remain are
dominated by `data: unknown` params and `unknown | Promise<unknown>`
callback returns, where `JSValue` is the semantically correct type).

- [x] The string-subset policy now also covers the DECL emitter
  (`moonbit_type_name` in `parser_moonbit.mbt` mirrors the FFI rule) and
  accepts `Applied(*Params, ...)` shapes — qualified aliases like
  `core.$ZodEmailParams` resolve into applied generic aliases the decl
  layer cannot expand, and previously missed the `Named`-only match.
  Every classic factory (`email` / `uuid` / `cuid` / ... ~40 fns) and the
  `ZodString` format methods now take `String?`.
- [x] `@internal` members are omitted from bridge scaffolds entirely
  (tsc's stripInternal semantics); `@deprecated` members survive only
  while they type naturally — one that could only widen to `JSValue`
  (zod's `_def` / `_input` / `_output`) is dropped. Tags are parsed from
  member-level JSDoc (`TsInterface.internal_members` /
  `deprecated_members`), travel through `extends` flattening, and gate
  both the decl emitter and the FFI struct decl + its bridge.js converter.
- [x] Constrained generic METHOD type params substitute their bounds at
  the boundary (`TsInterface.method_type_param_bounds`, applied in
  `append_interface_origin_fields`): every argument for a
  `pipe<T extends $ZodType>(target: T)` slot satisfies the bound, so
  `pipe` / `or` / `and` / `apply` / `refine` keep natural signatures.
  `brand<T extends PropertyKey>` folds its conditional return to `this`
  through the same substitution.
- [x] lib.d.ts prelude: `scripts/gen_lib_globals.sh` missed
  `declare type` aliases — PropertyKey, PromiseConstructorLike, and the
  *Decorator aliases are now in the generated registry, and
  `is_well_known_type_name` delegates to it, so ambient lib types no
  longer surface as unresolved-reference notes.
- [x] `extends_decision`: a plain-return function never extends a
  predicate-return signature (tsc: source "must be a type predicate").
  Folds `Ch extends (arg: any) => arg is infer R ? ... : this` to its
  false branch — `refine` returns `Schema[Output, Input, Internals]`
  instead of `JSValue`.
- Note: per-package JSValue counts in the env-gated realworld METRICS
  corpus will drift down on regeneration (budgets are upper bounds).

### 12. Indexed access on constrained type params (done 2026-07-15)

zod: `def: Internals["def"]` / `type: Internals["def"]["type"]` with
`Internals extends core.$ZodTypeInternals<Output, Input>`.
Fallback entries 241 -> 225.

- [x] `decl_eval_bound_indexed_access`: a `P["key"]` access whose base is
  one of the owning interface's CONSTRAINED type parameters resolves by
  looking the key up in the bound's field surface — through the qualified
  namespace import (`core.`), the barrel `export * from "./schemas.js"`
  (new `decl_resolve_interface_origin_deep` walks
  `record.reexports`), and the bound's own `extends` chain. Chained
  accesses evaluate inside-out, tracking the module each intermediate
  name is relative to; resolved names map back to canonical export names
  where the surface has one. Generic targets substitute supplied type
  arguments; a field that still references the target's own params
  without matching arguments is rejected (capture risk) and keeps the
  old widening.
- zod: `def : UnderscoreZodTypeDef` (typed opaque handle instead of
  `JSValue`), `type_ : SchemaType` / `ZodTypeType` (enum of the schema
  kind literal union).

### 13. zod runs end-to-end from MoonBit (done 2026-07-16)

Runtime-verified (node, `moon test --target js` against the generated
package): construct -> chain -> `safeParse` -> read the result. The four
smoke cases: string schema accept/reject, `.email()` format
validation, `object()` schema over an extern-built shape, and `parse`
returning the output handle.

- [x] `decl_exclusive_union_alias_interface_spec`: an applied generic
  alias behind a namespace import / barrel whose body folds through the
  mutually-exclusive object-union idiom (`{success: true, data: T,
  error?: never} | {success: false, data?: never, error: E}`)
  synthesizes a named interface — `safeParse` now returns
  `pub(all) struct ZodSafeParseResult { success : Bool, data :
  Core_output, error : ZodError[Core_output] }`. Shared by the lowering
  and the utility-interface collection walk so the struct is both
  referenced and emitted. Blanket cross-module alias inlining was
  measured to REGRESS (225 -> 418 fallbacks) and is deliberately not
  done; the inline fires only when the fold succeeds.
- [x] Exclusive fields keep their RAW passthrough type (no Option
  wrapper): generic-owner method wrappers return the raw JS object
  without conversion glue, and MoonBit's tagged Option representation
  crashes on the raw `undefined` the absent branch carries.
- [x] realworld zod smoke upgraded from construct-only to
  safeParse success/failure + email format round-trips.
- Known ergonomic gaps (deliberate, documented): concrete schemas
  (ZodString...) need `unsafeCast` to `Schema[...]` to reach
  `parse` / `safeParse` (generic base expansion is future work);
  `object()`'s shape is built with a small extern (`Record<string, any>`
  aliases stay opaque — the StringRecordOf* synthetics are equally
  unconstructible today).

### 14. zod full-feature pillars 2-3: error issues + object shapes (done 2026-07-16)

Runtime-verified continuations of #13 (pillar 1, generic-base
flattening, landed separately):

- [x] Pillar 2 — union aliases whose members cannot be
  runtime-discriminated join to their nearest COMMON BASE interface
  (`decl_join_union_alias_to_common_base`): zod's
  `$ZodIssue = $ZodIssueInvalidType | ... (11 members)` — all
  `$`-prefixed, so tagged lowering rejects every constructor name — all
  extend `$ZodIssueBase`, and the reference now lands on
  `pub(all) struct UnderscoreZodIssueBase { code : String?, input :
  JSValue?, path : Array[PropertyKey], message : String }` instead of an
  opaque handle. Nested union-alias members
  (`$ZodIssueInvalidUnion = NoMatch | MultipleMatch`) recurse; tagged- /
  enum-lowerable unions never reach the join. Runtime:
  `issues[0].message` / `.code == "invalid_type"` read directly.
- [x] Pillar 3 — `loose_shape_from_pairs(keys, values) ->
  Core__ZodLooseShape` (zod module hook, same pattern as react-router's
  `params_from_pairs`): `object()` shapes are built from MoonBit without
  hand-written externs. Runtime: object schema accepts a matching user
  object and rejects a non-object.
- [x] GENERIC owners reach the parse surface via the `as_schema` identity
  upcast (zod module hook): `as_schema(object(Some(shape), None))
  .safeParse(...)` — runtime-verified. MoonBit's nominal structs cannot
  express the extends relation, so the upcast makes it callable; a
  full per-generic-owner facade (monomorphized method wrappers like the
  mbt2ts generic-method glue) remains the eventual principled shape.

### 15. hono runs end-to-end: async handlers + middleware (done 2026-07-16)

Runtime-verified (node, `app.fetch(new Request(...))` round-trips through
MoonBit handlers): sync route via the existing `Context::text` wrapper
(`c.text("...", None, None)` — the generic-owner method glue was ALREADY
emitted for Context's callable-interface properties; the earlier "mbti
declares it but it doesn't exist" reading was wrong, the decl is the
method form), an async route returning `Promise[Response]`, a middleware
that `c.set`s a variable before `next()` with the handler reading it via
`c.get`, and 404 fallback.

- [x] hono module hooks (same pattern as zod's `as_schema`):
  `Hono::get_async / post_async / put_async / delete_async(path,
  (Context) -> Promise[Response])` — the HandlerInterface overload the
  generator picks is sync-only, but hono awaits whatever the handler
  returns and MoonBit closures ARE JS functions on the js backend, so the
  hooks register the closure raw with a typed surface.
- [x] `Hono::use_middleware(path?, (Context, () -> Promise[Unit]) ->
  Promise[Unit])`: pre-processing middleware calls `next()` and returns
  its promise. Post-processing (sequencing AFTER next resolves) needs
  Promise combinators on the MoonBit side and stays raw-JS territory.
- [x] realworld hono smoke upgraded from register-only to the full
  fetch round-trip (sync + async + middleware + 404).
- Remaining hono gaps (documented, not blocking): `app.fetch` returns
  `JSValue` (Response | Promise union), route methods return `HonoBase`
  (chain loses generics), path-param TYPE inference (`/users/:id` ->
  `{id: string}`) is TS type-level computation — same fundamental limit
  as zod's `z.infer`.

### 16. valibot + drizzle run end-to-end; boundary conversion fixes (done 2026-07-16)

Runtime-verified with node against regenerated packages. valibot:
`parse` / `safeParse` accept/reject and `pipe(string(), [minLength(3)])`
length validation. drizzle-orm: the `sql` tagged template builds an SQL
object from MoonBit (template-strings array via a tiny extern) and
`and_()` combines wrappers.

Four GENERAL boundary fixes fell out (all bugs any handle-round-tripping
package would hit):

- [x] Enum `to_js` converters are idempotent: a raw library value cast
  into a struct type carries the JS literal already (valibot's
  `string()` result flowing back into `parse(schema, ...)` crashed on
  "unexpected BaseSchemaKind tag: schema").
- [x] Struct `to_js` converters pass CLASS instances through untouched
  (MoonBit structs compile to plain objects, so an instance is always a
  raw library handle — spreading severed drizzle `SQL`'s prototype) and
  spread plain objects instead of rebuilding from declared fields
  (rebuilding stripped valibot's `~run` internals). Optional fields
  delete their key when absent instead of leaving a tagged None.
- [x] REST parameters spread at the call site in all three glue paths
  (import / func / callable) — `pipe(schema, ...items)` received the
  MoonBit array as its first variadic item ("item.~run is not a
  function"). Imports use `TsImport.param_is_rest`; funcs use
  `TsParam.is_rest`. Rest-param imports also FORCE the bridge glue —
  a direct `= "sql"` binding can never spread.
- [x] The decl emitter's reserved-word list synced to the FFI's 74-name
  list (`and` / `or` / `not` / ...): drizzle's `and` was emitted as
  callable `and_` but the mbti/decl surface advertised the uncallable
  bare name.
- realworld valibot smoke upgraded from construct-only to
  safeParse + pipe round-trips.
- Known cross-cutting gap (same family as zod's raw-typed result
  fields): matching a `T?` EXTERN RETURN with MoonBit `match` can crash
  on the raw `value | undefined` repr when MoonBit expects the tagged
  box — optional extern returns need repr-aware boxing glue. Reads via
  a small extern accessor work today. **Fixed in §17.**

### 17. Optional extern returns construct `Option` on the MoonBit side (done 2026-07-17)

Follow-up to the §16 known gap. Empirical repr table for `Option[T]` on
the JS backend: `String` / `Int` / struct instances / enum instances are
unboxed (`Some` = raw value, `None` = `undefined`); `Bool` uses the `-1`
sentinel; everything else — `JSValue`, `Double`, arrays, opaque
`#external` handles, generics, function/tuple types — uses a `{$tag, _0}`
box. A raw `value | undefined` extern return against a boxed `Option` is
not just crash-prone: a real value silently matches as `None`.

- [x] `__ts_mbt_wrap_option_return[T](raw : JSValue) -> T?` helper pair
  (absence check treats `undefined` and `null` as `None`; `%identity`
  cast for `Some`) injected once per generated package, from either the
  FFI emission (`ffi_option_return_wrap_helper_decls`) or the top-level
  wrapper pass (`bridge_option_return_wrap_helper_decls`), `contains`
  checks dedup the two.
- [x] Top-level `pub extern` fns with boxed-optional returns are demoted
  to `<name>_raw` externs plus a public wrapper by
  `add_bridge_public_wrappers` (same mechanism as enum-converter
  wrappers). Covers drizzle `and_` / `or_`, zod `getErrorMap`.
- [x] Class-method / getter `preserve` wrapper bodies use the wrap helper
  instead of a bare `unsafeCast` when the return is boxed-optional
  (drizzle `SQL::if_`, `One::get_one_config`, hono `Context` getters).
- [x] Non-preserve method / getter / index-accessor / function-field
  externs with boxed-optional returns emit a private raw extern
  (`_*_opt_ret_js`, `self` renamed `this_`) plus a public wrapper via
  `ffi_option_return_extern_pair` (valibot `ObjectEntries::op_get`).
- [x] The trailing `?` of a function-typed return
  (`() -> ((Props) -> JSValue)?`) binds to the function's result — a
  depth-0 `->` scan (`ffi_rendered_return_type_optional_inner`) keeps
  those on the raw passthrough.
- Verified: drizzle `match and_([...])` sees `Some` for real values and
  `None` for `undefined` (previously silent-`None` / crash); zod,
  valibot, hono scaffold smokes stay green.
- Still open (pre-existing, unrelated to Option): non-optional generated
  ENUM returns cross as raw strings (`nextFlag -> NodeFlag`), relying on
  idempotent to_js converters for round-trips; matching them in MoonBit
  needs a return-side `_from_js` conversion. **Resolved in §18** — the
  note was partly stale: top-level enum returns were already converted
  by the wrapper pass; the real broken vectors were index-signature
  accessors and empty structs.

### 18. Enum-typed accessors + index-signature-only interfaces (done 2026-07-17)

Investigating the §17 "raw enum returns" note empirically:

- Top-level fn enum returns were ALREADY converted
  (`nextFlag -> NodeFlag` demotes to a `String` raw extern + a wrapper
  calling `__ts_mbt_node_flag_from_js`) — the note was wrong about them.
- Class/interface METHOD returns never render enum types (they degrade
  to `String` at the ffi surface), so they exchange raw strings
  correctly at runtime; zero real-package occurrences. The decl-layer
  `.mbti` still advertises the enum names there — a surface divergence,
  not a runtime bug.
- The genuinely broken vectors, both fixed:
  - [x] `op_get` on `[k: string]: "a" | "b"` returned the raw string
    typed as the enum (match misbehaved) and `op_set` wrote MoonBit tag
    ints into the JS object. Both now route through
    `ffi_converted_return_extern_pair` / a `_to_js` wrapper pair
    (`ffi_rendered_generated_enum_info` decides; composes with the §17
    Option wrap for the `Enum?` getter return).
  - [x] Index-signature-only interfaces lowered to ZERO-FIELD structs,
    which MoonBit's JS backend value-erases — the instance compiled to
    `undefined` and every accessor crashed. Zero-field interface
    lowering now emits `#external pub type X` (matching what the decl
    layer already advertised in `.mbti`).
- Verified at runtime via the extended `realworld-literal-options`
  fixture: a `FlagMachine` class (method / getter / optional-method
  returns) plus a `FlagTable` index-signature interface with
  `op_get` -> `Some(R)` / missing -> `None` / `op_set(A)` round-trip.
- Return-side enum conversion machinery
  (`ffi_wrapper_return_body_expr`) also covers the preserve-wrapper
  bodies and any future path that renders enum returns.

### 19. Realworld budget recalibration + version-skew-tolerant node builtins (done 2026-07-17)

The env-gated `verify_realworld_typescript.sh` had drifted red after the
generic-base-flattening batches (zod fallbacks 225 -> ~1869 by the old
counting). Rebuilt a complete corpus root (repo-pinned zod 4.4.3 /
valibot 1.4.2 / hono 4.12.16 etc. plus fresh installs for the rest;
exact versions now recorded in `corpus/realworld-typescript.tsv`) and
recalibrated all three budget tables from measured values — the gate now
runs end to end (30 packages generated, checked, runtime-smoked) with
budgets enforced.

Generator fix found by the run:

- [x] `@types/node` routinely declares APIs newer than the running Node
  (`mkdtempDisposableSync` on node 22), and both
  `export { x } from "node:fs"` re-exports and
  `import { x } from "node:fs"` glue imports hard-fail at load time for
  a missing name. `node:*` bridges now route named access through the
  shared `import * as __ts_mbt_module` namespace
  (`ffi_bridge_tolerant_reexport_line`,
  `ffi_module_spec_prefers_namespace_named_imports`), so a missing name
  stays `undefined` until actually called.

Script smoke updates for current surfaces: glob escape/unescape/hasMagic
take `Options?` (wrap in `Some`), node:sqlite options gained
`limits`, and `StatementSync::get` now returns a real `Option` (the
section-17 wrap) — the smoke matches on it instead of reading the raw
value through an extern.

### 20. decl/ffi method surfaces aligned; methods carry real enum types (done 2026-07-17)

`bridge.mbti` advertised `declare pub fn flag_machine_advance(self) -> NodeFlag`
while `bridge.mbt` implemented `FlagMachine::advance(self) -> String` —
both the name and the type diverged. Fixed from both sides:

- [x] FFI class methods / getters / setters render param and return
  types with the field-style resolver (`ffi_struct_field_type_name`),
  so literal-union aliases surface as their generated enums instead of
  degrading to `String`. Conversions ride the section-18 machinery:
  enum returns via `ffi_converted_return_extern_pair` /
  `ffi_wrapper_return_body_expr`, enum params via new
  `ffi_enum_arg_expr` / `ffi_enum_param_raw_type` (`force~` pairs when
  only params need conversion; preserve-path wrappers convert before
  the `unsafeCast`). Setters got the same treatment.
- [x] Decl layer emits instance members as `Type::method` /
  `Type::get_x` / `Type::set_x` (snake-cased, reserved-suffixed) to
  match the FFI's naming; statics stay top-level `<class>_<method>`.
- Verified: `.mbti` and `.mbt` now agree line-for-line on the
  `FlagMachine` fixture (`FlagMachine::advance(self) -> NodeFlag` in
  both), and the runtime fixture matches enum constructors directly on
  method returns (`match advance(m) { R => ... }`,
  `peek() -> NodeFlag?` composes enum from_js with the Option wrap).
- Full gates green including the env-gated realworld corpus (30
  packages) and the drizzle / valibot / hono / zod scaffold smokes.

### Non-Goals (still)

- [ ] Do not turn this list into a checklist for "all of TypeScript". Each item
  must justify itself by removing real-world JSValue surface from the locked
  corpus.
- [ ] Do not pursue `any` / `unknown` AST distinction unless a downstream
  consumer needs it; the JSValue count is unaffected.

## Seamlessness Round 1 (2026-07-19)

A fresh-user walkthrough (npm install -> ts2mbt -> moon build -> node,
done twice: zod standalone and a 4-dep nanoid/ms/date-fns/axios app)
graded end-to-end usability at ~70% and surfaced four gaps, fixed in
priority order and each re-verified end-to-end in the walkthrough apps:

1. Promise consumption API: `Promise[T]` was opaque — async results
   could only be consumed from hand-written JS externs. Every generated
   package whose surface mentions `Promise[` now ships
   `Promise::then(on_ok)` (rejections stay loud), `Promise::then_catch`
   and `Promise::map`, backed by three `__ts_mbt_promise_*` bridge.js
   bindings. `axios.all(...).map(...).then_catch(...)` chains in pure
   MoonBit. Emission forces the self-contained JSValue/Promise decls
   (`state.needs_js_any/needs_promise`) since a surface can mention
   Promise only in doc comments.
2. Returned-function option unwrap (bug found by the walkthrough):
   `customAlphabet(...)` returns `(size?) => id`; MoonBit `None` reached
   the raw JS closure as `null`, JS default parameters never fired, and
   the id came back empty. `ffi_type_js_return_expr` now wraps
   Func-typed returns so each call routes args through the same converters
   direct parameters get (`ffi_returned_func_needs_arg_wrap`).
3. `ts2mbt generate` / `vendor` wiring: the `@tsmbt-bridge/*` `file:`
   dependencies are now written into the consumer's `package.json` in
   place (line-oriented insertion preserves formatting; copy-paste
   fallback when the shape defeats it) instead of a hint that silently
   vanished without `moon.mod.json`; packages that ship no declarations
   (`ms` without `@types/ms`) get a WARNING naming the `@types/`
   package instead of a silent function-less bridge; the moon.pkg
   import hint derives from `--out` instead of hardcoding
   `internal/generated`; AGENTS.md text matches the real behavior.
4. Typed JSValue constructors: `JSValue::from_string/from_double/
   from_int/from_bool/from_array` (identity externs) and
   `JSValue::object_from_pairs` (heterogeneous object literals) replace
   bare `unsafeCast` at the input boundary, emitted wherever the
   package declares JSValue.

Gate coverage: the axios build smoke now chains
`all().map().then_catch()` and builds a heterogeneous object via
`object_from_pairs`; the nanoid build smoke checks the returned
function's default-size and explicit-size paths. Budgets recalibrated
(the Promise layer + constructors add lines/JSValue refs per package).

MoonBit-native async integration (follow-up, same day): the JS backend
compiles `async fn` to CPS (an async fn value crosses to JS as a
2-continuation function — probed empirically; a GENERIC
`%async.suspend` intrinsic ICEs moonc v0.10.4, so the intrinsic stays
monomorphic on JSValue and only the public wrapper is generic). Every
package with a Promise surface now also ships:

- `Promise::wait(self : Promise[T]) -> T` — suspends the enclosing
  `async fn` until the promise settles; `await` in all but name.
- `pub suberror JsRejection { JsRejection(JSValue) }` — a rejected
  promise raises it, so `.wait() catch { JsRejection(e) => ... }`
  handles JS failures as ordinary MoonBit errors.
- `run_async(f : async () -> Unit)` — kicks an async fn from a sync
  context (main / tests); unhandled async errors exit non-zero.

Verified end-to-end on real axios: `all(vals).wait()` resolves inside
an async fn, and a connection-refused `get` surfaces as a caught
`JsRejection`. The axios build smoke covers both paths via
`run_async(smoke_async)`. The signature surface stays `-> Promise[T]`
(non-breaking; fire-and-forget and combinator use keep the raw
promise) — `.wait()` is the conversion point into async MoonBit.

moonbitlang/async integration mode (follow-up): when the consumer
module (nearest manifest walking up from the OUTPUT dir; `_build/`
outputs excluded, same rationale as the package.json wiring guard)
depends on `moonbitlang/async`, the emitter swaps the self-contained
`Promise::wait` for a delegation to `moonbitlang/async/js_async` —
which 0.18+ ships exactly for this: an `#external Promise[X]` with a
coroutine-scheduled `wait(abort_controller?)`. The generated package
gains `Promise::std()` (identity cast to `@js_async.Promise`) and the
`moon.pkg` import; `run_async` / `then` / `then_catch` / `map` stay.
Consequences, all probe-verified E2E on real axios: `async fn main`
works directly (the compiler requires importing moonbitlang/async for
async main — this IS the seamless entry, no `run_async` needed),
`@async.with_timeout` composes over bridge promises, and cancellation
plumbs through the official `AbortController`. Adding the dep to
moon.mod + re-running `ts2mbt generate` is the whole upgrade. Both
section texts live side by side in moonbit_js_ffi.mbt so the modes
cannot drift. Probes also confirmed the raw-CPS self-contained `wait`
keeps working under the @async event loop, and that a typealias-based
deep integration (`pub typealias @js_async.Promise as Promise`)
compiles and runs — deferred because methods cannot be defined on a
foreign aliased type, which would fracture the then/map surface.

Cross-API validation (same day): a four-package showcase app
(moonbitlang/async consumer) runs `async fn main` over node:fs
promises (write -> read roundtrip), jose (generateSecret -> SignJWT
builder chain -> sign -> 3-segment JWT), hono (in-process
`app.request` roundtrip, status 200 + body), and axios.all — exit 0,
no run_async, no hand-written awaits. The walkthrough surfaced and
fixed two real generator/runtime gaps:

- `<fn>.__promisify__` declarations (@types/node's alias for "the
  promisified form of fn") lowered to a literal runtime member access
  that does not exist — a guaranteed TypeError on all 45 node:fs
  `*Promisify` surfaces. `ffi_js_member_access_or_promisify` now
  lowers them to `util.promisify(fn)` (honoring promisify.custom),
  with the `node:util` import injected only when used. The node:fs
  build smoke covers write/readFilePromisify + `.wait()` end-to-end
  via `run_async`.
- `@js_async.Promise::wait` calls `.then` on the raw value, but
  TS-declared Promise returns are sometimes plain values at runtime
  (hono's sync-handler `request` returns a bare Response). The
  integration-mode `wait` now normalizes through `Promise.resolve`
  first, matching JS `await` leniency (the self-contained wait was
  already lenient via its then_catch glue).

Remaining friction observed in the showcase (recorded, not blocking):
hono's `fetch` / `request` returns are JSValue-typed (one unsafeCast
to `Promise[...]` before waiting), union params take nested
constructors (`PathOrFileDescriptor::PathLikeValue(PathLike::
StringValue(...))` — flat convenience constructors like the existing
`path_like_from_string` hooks cover node:fs but not every package),
and web-platform types (Response.status / .text) still need one-line
externs until a lib.dom prelude exists.

Run-verification tests (2026-07-20): the arc is now pinned by tests
that RUN the converted code, not just inspect it. A wbtest keeps the
two Promise-layer section texts coherent (self-contained =
`%async.suspend` + JsRejection-raising rejections; integration =
`Promise::std` + AbortController + `Promise.resolve` leniency, no
suspend intrinsic; both share wait / run_async / JsRejection). The
realworld gate grew `verify_async_integration_app`: a fresh consumer
app depending on moonbitlang/async vendors axios + hono, asserts the
generated bridges actually switched to integration mode, then builds
warning-clean (under warning_guard) and executes `async fn main`
covering awaited `axios.all`, `@async.with_timeout` composition,
AbortController plumbing, and the bare-Response leniency on hono's
sync `request`. Fallout: integration-mode `JsRejection` is `pub(all)`
(nothing constructs it in that mode — rejections raise `@js_async`'s
error), and the node_fs smoke unlinks its sync scratch file instead
of leaving it at the repo root.

Async-callback lowering (2026-07-20): the REVERSE direction now works —
TS APIs that RECEIVE `(...) => Promise<T>` callbacks (React 19
`useActionState`-style actions, promise-returning handlers) accept a
MoonBit `async fn` directly. Top-level fn params rendered as
`(A, B) -> Promise[T]` lower to `async (A, B) -> T raise` on the
natural-name public wrapper (and in `bridge.mbti`), glued back through
a new `Promise::from_async` emitted in both promise layers. Design
facts, all probe-verified before landing:

- MoonBit JS CPS ABI: an async fn that completes WITHOUT suspending
  calls neither continuation — it returns `Result[Option[T], Error]`
  directly. A naive `new Promise((res, rej) => f(args, res, rej))`
  wrapper silently drops synchronous raises. The self-contained
  `Promise::from_async` therefore performs resolve/reject INSIDE a
  noraise Unit wrapper async fn, so the trampoline can ignore the
  sync-completion return value safely.
- Integration mode must spawn: a callback CPS-started raw from JS has
  no coroutine context and `@js_async.Promise::wait` panics.
  `@js_async.Promise::from_async` (which `@coroutine.spawn`s — its doc
  marks it "for exporting MoonBit code to JavaScript") is the delegate;
  the integration `run_async` now also spawns through it (the previous
  raw-CPS trampoline would panic on the first integration-mode wait).
- `run_async` accepts `async () -> Unit raise` in both modes and
  reports errors through an explicit catch (console.error + exit 1) —
  synchronous raises included.
- Not lowered (recorded friction): optional callbacks
  (`((...) -> Promise[T])?`), interface/struct-field callbacks, class
  method callback params, and union-typed handler slots
  (`V | Promise<V>`, axios interceptors).

Tests: bridge wbtest pins the lowering (wrapper + glue + `_raw`
demotion + mbti rewrite + non-promise/optional callbacks staying raw)
and the section coherence (`Promise::from_async` identical signature in
both layers, integration run_async spawning via @js_async). The
realworld gate grew `verify_async_callback_app` twice (self-contained +
integration): a `useStateAction`-shaped fixture package is vendored,
surface markers asserted, then the app RUNS a MoonBit async fn as the
action — awaited TS promise inside the callback, two dispatches folding
state, and a synchronous raise surfacing as a caught rejection.

Round 2 (same day) — remaining callback positions: the lowering moved
into a shared `@parser.moonbit_async_callback_lowering` helper (one
detector for the decl `.mbti` and ffi `bridge.mbt` renderings, so the
divergence gate keeps them identical) and now also covers:

- optional callbacks `((...) -> Promise[T])?` -> `(async (...) -> T
  raise)?` with `Option::map` glue (Some/None structure preserved);
- interface methods / function-field method wrappers, both receiver
  shapes: generic receivers via the `(self.field)(glue)` wrapper,
  non-generic receivers via a forced extern/wrapper pair whose extern
  keeps the raw promise-returning callback types;
- class methods (instance + static, preserve and extern-pair paths),
  reusing the enum-param pair mechanics.

Struct FIELD types deliberately stay raw: fields are identity views
over JS objects (a stored JS function is not CPS-callable), so the
conversion point is the method wrapper / `Promise::from_async` at
construction time. Budget note: one playwright promise-callback
signature moved from the tuple/array bucket into callback/function
(885->886 / 170->169, total unchanged) — recalibrated. The gate
fixture package grew `onCommit` (generic interface method), `Notifier`
(non-generic interface method), `TaskQueue` (class methods), and
`runWithFallback` (optional callback, Some + None) — all RUN in both
promise layers.

Round 3 (same day) — the last two recorded frictions:

- Union handler returns `V | Promise<V>` (axios-interceptor shape,
  React 19 `useActionState`): a new
  `@checker.classify_promise_like_union` /
  `normalize_promise_like_union_return` pair rewrites callback RETURN
  unions of exactly {T, Promise<T>/PromiseLike<T>} to `Promise[T]` in
  every Func-type renderer of both layers (ffi inline + alias, decl
  inline + method parts). Sound both ways because `Promise::wait` is
  resolve-lenient in both modes, and it lets the async-callback
  lowering fire on sync-or-async slots. React's `useActionState`
  scaffold surface is now literally `action : async (State) -> State
  raise` (three hook-tuple test expectations updated from the opaque
  `UseActionStateActionCallback` form).
- Short-owner opaque callback synthesis: `decl_rewrite_inline_callback_
  param_type` now SKIPS the `<Owner><Param>Callback` substitution when
  the callback returns promise-like, so `runAction`-style exports keep
  the structural form and lower like everything else.

Fallout fixed along the way: the round-2 property-get extern for
sanitized members deduped by snake_case and collided on playwright's
`$eval` / `$$eval` — the getter name now embeds the field name
verbatim (unique per struct). Corpus effect of the normalization is a
net naturalization win — zod JSValue fallback 1901 -> 1631 lines and
JSValue-typed functions 607 -> 525, with smaller wins in valibot /
axios / marked / commander / react-router — 13 budget rows
recalibrated from a nobudget collection run. Gate fixture grew
`Interceptor` (union-return `use` handler — also regression-covers the
sanitized-member getter) and `runAction`; both RUN in both promise
layers.

Round 4 (same day) — checker-driven JSValue concretization: the
member-level conditional case is CLOSED. `Applied(GenericIface, args)`
references whose members hide behind conditionals over the interface's
own type params now specialize into synthesized monomorphic interfaces
(`decl_conditional_member_interface_spec`, mirroring the
exclusive-union alias synthesis: shared by the lowering and the
collection walk, fires only when EVERY conditional member decides).
The decision is a decl-layer structural `extends` (name equality ->
true; a required target field missing from the source's
extends-chain-merged fields -> false; anything else undecided) — the
shared checker `extends_decision` is deliberately untouched since it
feeds the TS7 oracle. A resolved branch then rides the whole earlier
pipeline: alias inlining -> `| null` optional collapse -> union-return
normalization -> async-callback lowering. Net effect on real axios:

  interceptors.use : JSValue   (before)
  AxiosInterceptorManagerInternalAxiosRequestConfig::use_(
    self, (async (InternalAxiosRequestConfig[JSValue]) ->
    InternalAxiosRequestConfig[JSValue] raise)?, ...)   (after)

and the realworld axios smoke now registers a MoonBit async fn as a
REQUEST INTERCEPTOR on a real axios instance (axios awaits the
from_async promise; a marker count proves exactly one run; the
connection-refused rejection still catches). A recursion guard
(in-progress set + first-registration-only field walks) keeps
self-referential instantiations from looping — date-fns crashed the
first version. Fixture: `conditional-member-entry.d.ts` pins both
branch outcomes (Payload lacks Ack's required field -> async handler
slot; Ack extends itself -> sync callback).

Surveyed but NOT concretizable via the checker (recorded): zod's
remaining JSValue params are TS `unknown` (honest widening); playwright
residuals are anonymous OBJECT-LITERAL option params (needs synthesized
option structs, an emitter feature); overloaded members still widen
(`interceptors` property itself is an anonymous-object type — one typed
extern bridges to the specialized manager until then).

Round 5 (same day) — extends upcast helpers, closing the dominant
naturalness friction from the 3-package evaluation (an idiomatic
zod+axios+node:fs app needed 7 escape hatches, of which inheritance
casts were the largest class). Interfaces whose `extends` bases do NOT
flatten (generic roots over generic bases — ZodObject over its zod
core base — and class bases — `interface AxiosInstance extends Axios`)
now emit sound `%identity` upcast helpers named after the type-guard
convention: `instance.asAxios().get(...)` replaces
`(unsafeCast(instance) : Axios).get(...)`. Pieces:

- `decl_unflattened_interface_bases` records skipped bases on the
  cloned interfaces (both cloners), mirroring the flatten decision in
  `append_interface_origin_fields`;
- both emitters (ffi struct decl + decl interface decl) render the
  helper with the base reference clamped to the EMITTED arity (source
  `_ZodType<A,B,C>` vs emitted `UnderscoreZodType[Internals]`);
- a text-level `prune_mismatched_upcast_helpers` pass drops helpers
  whose base reference still cannot match the surviving declaration —
  zod's `$ZodType`/`_ZodType` SANITIZATION COLLISION (both become
  `UnderscoreZodType` with different arities) makes some mismatches
  undetectable earlier; the prune keeps mbt and mbti in lockstep.

Budget note: helpers whose base type args widen to JSValue count into
the fallback metrics (react +14 "JSValue functions" are all usable
`asComponent`-style helpers; valibot +68 surface lines likewise) — 10
rows recalibrated. Naturalness evaluation delta: the 3-package app's
escape hatches drop 7 -> 6 (asAxios), with ZodObject->Schema still
needing a cast because zod's base chain hides behind the sanitization
collision. Remaining hatches ranked: anonymous object-literal
properties/params, overloaded members, JSValue value slots, and the
zod name collision (needs collision-aware type identifiers).

Round 6 (same day) — anonymous object-literal synthesis, the top-ranked
remaining hatch. `Object(fields)` types in member positions now
synthesize named structs (`<Owner><Member>` for properties,
`<Owner><Method><Param>` / `<Owner><Member>Options` for params,
`...Result` for returns), registered through a per-emission registry
(populated during cloning, drained after interface AND class cloning in
both layers — the decl emitter runs first in a package bundle so the
ffi drain sees a superset, and the expose pass evens the surfaces).
Rewrite sites: interface fields (`append_lowered_interface_field`),
class properties (`clone_class_property_in_scope`), class method
params (`clone_class_method_in_scope`), and Func-typed member
params/returns. Guards: literal keys only, 1..24 fields, same-name
different-shape collisions stay widened.

Everything composes: axios's `interceptors` property becomes
`AxiosInterceptors { request : AxiosInterceptorManagerInternal
AxiosRequestConfig; ... }` — the round-4 conditional-member
specialization landing inside a round-6 synthesized struct — so the
fully generated chain
`instance.asAxios().get_axios_interceptors().request.use_(Some(async
fn(config) { ... }))` runs with ZERO hand externs. playwright options
params become real structs with their literal-union fields enum-ized
(`ElementHandle::click(self, ElementHandleClickOptions?)`, 255
synthesized option structs).

Corpus effect (28 budget rows recalibrated): playwright JSValue-typed
functions 411 -> 200 and JSValue surface 1336 -> 827; zod 526 -> 485;
node:crypto 24 -> 16; net -639 JSValue surface lines across changed
rows (small increases in valibot / pino / react-router / lodash are
the synthesized structs' own JSValue-typed fields — new usable
surface, not lost signal). Naturalness evaluation: the 3-package app
drops to 5 escape hatches (interceptors extern eliminated).

Round 7 (same day) — overloaded-member merging + collision-free type
identifiers, the two hatches picked from the round-6 ranking.

Overload merging (`src/bridge/moonbit_decl.mbt`): the canonical TS
overload pattern — same member re-declared with extra TRAILING params
and the same return type — previously kept only the first declaration
(rest silently dropped, callers lost the richer arity). Now
`decl_merge_overload_param_lists` merges into the LONGEST signature
with the extra params optionalized (`decl_optionalize_type` wraps in
`| undefined` unless already optional-like), applied in
`append_class_method_once` (guards: same key / static / return, no
method-level type params) and in `append_lowered_interface_field`
(which was restructured so lowering + inline-object rewrites compute
the final type BEFORE the merge attempt). `Store::get(key)` +
`get(key, fallback)` becomes `get(self, key : String, fallback :
String?)`. Fixture `member-overload-entry.d.ts` + wbtest cover the
interface and class forms; the mitt gate smoke needed `emit(ev,
Some(ev))` since `emit`'s second param is now merged-optional.

Collision-free identifiers: `$` in TS type names now sanitizes to a
distinct `Dollar` token in BOTH identifier paths (`ffi_type_identifier`
/ `moonbit_type_identifier`) instead of the generic `Underscore`
mangle, so zod's `$ZodType` (DollarZodType) no longer collides with
`_ZodType` (UnderscoreZodType). That collision was what forced the
round-5 prune to drop zod's upcast helpers; with distinct names the
helpers survive with precise type args and the fully generated chain
`user_schema.asUnderscoreZodType().asZodType().safeParse(input, None)`
runs end-to-end — the last hand `unsafeCast` in the eval app's zod
path is gone. The zod domain glue return type follows the rename
(`Core_DollarZodLooseShape`).

Gates: full suite 2532 green, all scaffold/fixture/example/realworld
gates green, budget recalibration ZERO drift (the merges and renames
net out). Naturalness evaluation: the 3-package app drops to 4 escape
hatches. Remaining ranked: mutating config headers inside interceptors
(AxiosHeaders methods), Buffer.toString, JSValue value slots (zod
shape values need per-value casts).

Round 8 (same day) — checker-driven JSValue concretization round 2:
`typeof` value queries. Mining the generated corpus surfaced one
dominant inferable cluster: `readonly reference: typeof someFunction`
members (valibot declares ~190, axios exposes `typeof Axios` /
`typeof isCancel` style statics, glob/yaml similar) all collapsed to
bare `JSValue` because `typeof` of a GENERIC or overloaded function
never resolved. Fixes, all in the decl lowering:

- `typeof_func_decl_to_func_type` substitutes each type parameter by
  its declared bound (`Any` when unbounded; bounds may reference
  earlier params, so they resolve left-to-right) before lowering, so
  a generic function's `typeof` still yields a concrete callable
  shape (`typeof ip` -> `() -> IpAction[String, JSValue]`).
- the resolver now collects sibling overloads (`find_func_decls`) and
  merges the round-7 trailing-param pattern into one signature before
  falling back to the least-widening pick.
- `typeof_value_type_is_stable` learned that `null` / `undefined` /
  `never` are CONCRETE types (an `Action<T, undefined>` type argument
  was destabilizing the whole reference), and gained an
  `allow_widened~` mode — used whenever the resolved shape is a
  callable — under which `any` / `unknown` / `object` slots are
  acceptable: they render as `JSValue` params while arity and
  callability stay real.
- `ReturnType<...>` / `Parameters<...>` lower their operand FIRST, so
  `ReturnType<typeof addPairToJSMap>` reduces through the resolved
  function type. This also kills a real leak: yaml's `Pair::toJSON`
  previously rendered `-> ReturnType` backed by a synthesized
  `declare pub type ReturnType` opaque extern.
- ambient classes (`declare class`) parse `static readonly X = "lit"`
  literal initializers into literal TYPES (parser_function.mbt was
  discarding the initializer expression) — string/bool/int literals
  only, mirroring tsc's own inference so the TS7 oracle is safe by
  construction; yaml's `Scalar.BLOCK_FOLDED` getters now return
  single-case enums instead of `JSValue`. A bridge-side
  `decl_infer_literal_property_type` covers runtime-class clones the
  same way via `static_field_inits`.

Fixture `typeof-inference-entry.d.ts` + wbtest pin all three
behaviors. Oracle: TP 2338 / FP 0 / PFLEGAL 0 / TN 1750 — byte-equal
to the recorded baseline. Corpus (5 budget rows recalibrated): axios
JSValue functions 61 -> 37 and surface 190 -> 166; yaml 67 -> 62 /
177 -> 172; valibot unknown/any 1166 -> 926 (-240) with surface
1738 -> 1858 — the resolved `reference` members now emit callable
method decls whose `IpAction[String, JSValue]` rendering the cause
heuristic files under tuple/array, i.e. the same widening now ships
usable callable surface instead of a bare `JSValue` slot.

Remaining inferable clusters recorded for later rounds: `expects:
null` literal members (~104 in valibot) still widen — typing them
needs an opaque null representation decision; value-or-function
unions (`ErrorMessage<T> = string | ((issue) => string)`, ~157
`message` members) need an untagged-union construction story.

Round 9 (same day) — both recorded clusters landed.

Instantiated generic union aliases: NON-generic `string | fn` union
aliases already lowered to tagged-union enums with constructors and JS
converter glue; the gap was the APPLIED generic form
(`ErrorMessage<Issue>`), which inlined to an anonymous union that the
inline synthesizer refuses (function members) and so widened to
JSValue. `decl_instantiated_union_alias_name` now names the
instantiation (`ErrorMessageOfIssue` via the utility suffix namer)
when the substituted+lowered body is a union WITH a function member
that `tagged_union_type_alias_decl` accepts, registering it in a
`decl_synthesized_union_aliases` registry (reset at decl-emit start;
drained by the decl emitter after all cloning and merged into the
FFI's exported tagged unions — decl runs first in a bundle, mirroring
the round-6 object-struct registry). Hooked into both the same-module
`applied_type_alias` inline path and the qualified/cross-module
`decl_inline_qualified_applied_alias`, plus the collection-walk
mirror so interfaces referenced ONLY from the enum's function-typed
case payloads still get their declarations (valibot's ArrayIssue /
VariantIssue / MapIssue / RecordIssue / SetIssue compiled only after
this). The case-payload dependency scan got a shared helper
(`tagged_union_case_named_refs`) that walks Func params/returns —
both the decl opaque-companion list and the FFI external-type marking
previously only saw bare `Named` / `Array(Named)` payloads.

`null` literal members: a member typed exactly `null` (valibot's
`readonly expects: null`, ~98 members) now references a shared opaque
`JSNull` companion instead of widening — referenced-but-undeclared
names already get their opaque decl emitted by both layers, so the
representation costs one `declare pub type JSNull` line; the name is
exempted from the emit-time unresolved-reference sanity note.

Fixture `union-alias-instantiation-entry.d.ts` + wbtest pin both.
valibot corpus effect (2 budget rows): JSValue surface 1858 -> 1437
(-421), unknown/any 926 -> 504; 140 ErrorMessageOf* enums, message
members now `ErrorMessageOfIpIssueOfTinput1?`-style typed enums with
`..._from_string` constructors and typeof-discriminated from_js glue.
zod/yaml rows unchanged (zod's message unions were already
string-subset-lowered; yaml's value-or-function members are anonymous
inline unions — still open, needs an inline construction story).

Round 10 (same day) — ANONYMOUS inline value-or-function unions, the
last recorded value-or-function gap. `ffi_synthesize_inline_union`
refused every union with a function member (a guard from the react
hooks era whose motivating case — `S | (() => S)` with S widened —
can't reach synthesis anyway: the widened arm has no runtime
discriminator). Lifting it needed two safety pieces:

- SHAPE-tagged constructor names: a structural alias name that spells
  every function case as bare `FnValue` would merge yaml's
  `uniqueKeys: boolean | ((a: ParsedNode, b: ParsedNode) => boolean)`
  and `sortMapEntries: boolean | ((a: Pair, b: Pair) => number)` into
  one `Auto_BoolValue_or_FnValue` with whichever payload registered
  first. `moonbit_inline_union_func_case_name` (parser package, shared
  by the decl renderer and the bridge FFI so both compute identical
  names) encodes params and return into the case name:
  `Auto_BoolValue_or_FnPairPairToDoubleValue` vs
  `Auto_BoolValue_or_FnParsedNodeParsedNodeToBoolValue`. All three FFI
  sites that derive the synthetic name now go through one
  `ffi_inline_union_shaped_cases` helper.
- at most ONE function member per union: every function case
  discriminates via `typeof === "function"`, so a second would be
  indistinguishable at the boundary — both sides refuse those.
- Named siblings must be RUNTIME-DISCRIMINABLE: a function-armed union
  only synthesizes when every Named member is a well-known JS global
  constructor (`moonbit_inline_union_runtime_named_ok`: RegExp / URL /
  URLPattern / Date / Buffer / typed arrays / ...) whose `instanceof`
  works in the generated converter. The first attempt (reject local
  type params) missed `useState(initialState: S | (() => S))` — its
  `S` isn't registered as a local param on that path — and the
  generated from_js tested `value instanceof S` against a name that
  doesn't exist in bridge.js. Interfaces / aliases / type params all
  fail the allowlist, so only truly discriminable unions synthesize.

The synthesized-inline emission loop also switched its payload
dependency scan to `tagged_union_case_named_refs` (playwright's
`(url: URL) => boolean` case needed the `URL` external companion that
the old bare-Named scan missed). Fixture `inline-fn-union-entry.d.ts`
+ wbtest pin the two-distinct-signatures case.

Corpus (net, after the runtime-named guard): playwright's
`page.route(...)` family now takes
`Auto_RegExpValue_or_StringValue_or_URLPatternValue_or_FnURLToBoolValue`
instead of JSValue (functions 200 -> 196, surface 827 -> 811); yaml
172 -> 168 with uniqueKeys/sortMapEntries typed; node:fs 34 -> 28;
lodash 1651 -> 1644; pino / zod / axios / node:util small drops;
react unchanged (its candidate unions all carry interface-typed value
arms that the guard correctly refuses).

Round 11 (same day) — event-map literal-overload specialization, the
top pick from the unlock survey. Interface members overloaded on a
literal first param followed by a listener
(`on(event: 'close', listener: (page) => void)` x56 event names on
playwright's Page alone) merge to nothing under the round-7
trailing-param rule, so only the first declaration survived with both
params widened. Each such family (>= 2 distinct literals — a lone
literal-first method is not an event map; and the second param must be
a function, so literal dispatch like react's `createElement('div')`
stays untouched) now synthesizes per-literal companion members:
`on_close((Browser) -> Unit) -> Browser`. Pieces:

- detection runs on the PRE-rewrite lowering in
  `append_lowered_interface_field` (the inline-callback naming pass
  would otherwise hide the `(Literal, Func)` shape behind a named
  opaque callback);
- `decl_event_member_families` records (literal, companion type) per
  owner+member so the FIRST overload's companion appears retroactively
  when the second literal arrives; companions re-push into every clone
  (the decl and FFI layers each clone the interface — the per-clone
  `seen_field_names` keeps it idempotent);
- `decl_event_member_specials` maps each companion to
  (JS member, literal); the FFI emits
  `#| (self, arg0) => self.on("close", arg0)` — and on
  generic-preserved receivers a BOUND-closure getter
  (`(o) => (...args) => o.on("close", ...args)`) so `this` survives;
- listener returns declared `any` / `unknown` normalize to `void` in
  the companion (`(page) => any` is fire-and-forget for the emitter) —
  without this every companion line carried a spurious `JSValue`
  return and playwright's metric tripled.

Runtime-verified: a generated `browser.on_close(fn(_b) { ... })`
registers through the real `.on("close", ...)` and fires (smoke in
scratch; fixture `event-map-entry.d.ts` + wbtest pin the shapes).
playwright gains 76 typed `on_* / once_*` methods; JSValue functions
196 -> 191 with surface 811 -> 842 (+31: companions whose payload
types still widen — new usable surface). Class-METHOD event maps
(ws / chokidar / node:fs watchers) are not yet specialized — the same
registry approach extends to `append_class_method_once` +
`ffi_class_method_decl_to_moonbit`; recorded as the next step.

Round 12 (same day) — nonempty-tuple normalization (#2 of the unlock
survey). `[T, ...T[]]` (valibot / zod `issues` fields) is a nonempty
ARRAY for the bridge surface; as a tuple it widened to
`Array[JSValue]` and lost the element type. `decl_nonempty_tuple_element`
recognizes a trailing rest whose element equals every fixed element
and the Tuple lowering arm rewrites to `Array(element)`; boundary
representation is unchanged (a JS array either way). Elements that
resolve concretely now surface (`issues : Array[BaseIssue[TInput_1]]?`);
the ~70 that remain `Array[JSValue]` carry `InferIssue<TSchema>`
conditional elements — honest widening. Zero budget drift. The
common-base ELEMENT join half of the survey item turned out to be
already covered: `Array(Named(alias))` lowers the alias through
`decl_join_union_alias_to_common_base` on the Named arm.

Round 13 (same day) — record-and-class intersections (#5 of the
survey: the axios eval-app's last interceptor hatch). axios's
`AxiosRequestHeaders = RawAxiosRequestHeaders & AxiosHeaders` widened
to an unresolved opaque name, so `config.headers` inside an
interceptor had NO usable surface even though the `AxiosHeaders`
CLASS (set / get / has / set_content_type / ...) was fully generated.
`decl_intersection_single_class` resolves an intersection to its
single declared-CLASS member when every sibling is record-ish (object
literals, `Partial<...>` / `Record<...>` applications, aliases that
resolve to neither class nor interface — an interface sibling
refuses, dropping its fields would lose surface). The alias now emits
`pub type AxiosRequestHeaders = AxiosHeaders` (transparent) and
`config.headers.set(Some("X-Trace"), Some(v), None)` type-checks —
compile-verified against the generated axios package. Fixture
`intersection-class-entry.d.ts` + wbtest pin the rule. Zero budget
drift.

Survey status: #1 event maps (interfaces) DONE round 11, #2 nonempty
tuples DONE round 12, #5 AxiosHeaders DONE round 13. Remaining: #3
schema value slots (zod `loose_shape_from_pairs` still takes
`Array[JSValue]`; a `$ZodType`-bounded value slot + upcast-at-call is
the sketch), #4 lodash chain generics (big, budgeted), and the
class-METHOD event maps follow-up from round 11 (ws / chokidar /
node:fs watchers).

Round 14 (same day) — #3 schema value slots + #4 method-level
generics, closing the survey.

#3: the zod module hook gains a TYPED shape builder alongside the raw
one — `loose_shape_of(keys, values : Array[Schema[JSValue, JSValue,
JSValue]])` accepts the same upper bound `as_schema` produces, so the
gate smoke's shape entry is now
`loose_shape_of(["name"], [as_schema(string(None))])` with no
per-value unsafeCast.

#4: `map<U>(fn: (item: T) => U): CollectionChain<U>` on a GENERIC
owner widened U to JSValue on every chain-style API. The member's own
binder now survives on the pure-MoonBit wrapper:
`fn[T, U] CollectionChain::map(self, (T) -> U) -> CollectionChain[U]`.
Pieces:
- both interface cloners now CARRY `method_type_params` (they emitted
  `[]`, so the renderers never saw the binder);
- both renderers thread the member's binder (interface methods carry
  it out-of-band in `iface.method_type_params`; inline object members
  as `GenericFunc`) — the decl side pushes it as local type params and
  emits a combined prefix, the FFI side routes through a monomorphic
  getter returning a BOUND closure and a `pub fn[T, U]` wrapper
  (generic externs are forbidden; a plain fn casting the fetched
  closure is not);
- binder names whose occurrences were widened away are FILTERED from
  the prefix (`*_rendered_mentions_param` token scan) — an unused fn
  type parameter is a hard error [4027] (zod's `register` / `brand`
  hit this immediately);
- while smoking this against a real prototype-method implementation,
  the PRE-EXISTING generic-receiver form `(self.first)()` turned out
  to lose `this` (extracts the prototype method, calls it unbound —
  TypeError on any class-based library). ALL generic-receiver members
  now fetch a bound closure (`(o) => (...args) => o.first(...args)`)
  through the getter; the gate's sanitized-member marker moved to the
  bound form.

Runtime-verified: `c.map(fn(x : Double) { x.to_string() })` returns a
usable `CollectionChain[String]` and `compact()/first()` no longer
throw on class-implemented chains. Fixture `chain-generics-entry.d.ts`
+ wbtest; the StatsBase wbtest moved to the bound-getter expectation.
Corpus (8 rows): playwright JSValue functions 191 -> 179, lodash
288 -> 286 with surface 1644 -> 1634, zod 1497 -> 1493, source-map
-1; pino +1 line (a preserved generic slot now renders — new usable
surface). Top-level generic FUNCTIONS (`chain<T>(items)`) still widen
— that path has no receiver to hang a getter on; recorded as open.

Round 15 (same day) — CLASS-method event maps, the round-11
follow-up. Detection had to run on the RAW method (the clone rewrites
the listener to a named opaque callback, hiding the `(Literal, Func)`
shape — the same trap the interface path hit); the companion is built
from the raw method (first param dropped, `any`/`unknown` listener
returns normalized to `void`) and THEN cloned through
`clone_class_method_in_scope`, with the same >= 2-distinct-literals
activation, per-clone re-push, and `decl_event_member_specials`
registration. The FFI class-method emitter consults the registry and
injects the literal at both instance js_call sites
(`(self, listener) => self.on("change", listener)`). ws gains 18
typed `on_*` companions (`WebSocket::on_message` etc.; surface +12 —
companions whose payload types still widen); chokidar's FSWatcher
declares no literal overloads of its own (EventEmitter inheritance)
so it is unaffected. Fixture `event-map-entry.d.ts` extended with the
Watcher class + wbtest.

Profiled with `moon bench --target native` + callgrind over the release
`tscheck` binary (`--parse` / full, `--iters N`; use
`--toggle-collect=<mangled check entry>` to isolate the check phase from
the parse). Five landed batches, all behavior-preserving (full suite
2523 green, oracle byte-identical TP 2338 / FP 0 / TN 1750 / MISS 396,
every gate green):

1. Parser whole-source rescans (`20ff7e7`): `from_source_with_jsx`
   lowered the FULL source 3x per parse (`@noImplicitThis` x2,
   `@filename:`); all whole-source markers now come from one
   `scan_source_directive_flags` pass over `@` positions. The ~10
   conformance-header detectors each sliced+lowered their own 1KB head
   -- multiplied by JSX speculation re-entering `from_source_with_jsx`
   on sub-sources (2k+ nested parses on parserharness.ts); the head is
   now computed once per parse and threaded through. `parse_jsdoc_block`
   rewritten single-pass over StringViews (was 3+ owned strings per
   comment line); the lexer passes the comment span without copying.
2. Checker structural scans (`58527b4`): `iface_extends_reaches` was
   O(ifaces^2 x chain) via per-step rescans of every interface decl
   (~7.5% of a dom.generated.d.ts run) -- now a prebuilt name->extends
   adjacency map + hash-set DFS. `is_lib_global_value`/`_type` (generated
   1k/2.2k-arm string matches, probed once per reference; 9.6% of a
   generic-heavy run) now memoize per name via gen_lib_globals.sh.
3. Bench coverage: `moon bench` gains JSDoc-heavy (300 documented
   decls) and old-style-cast-heavy (200 funcs, JSX speculation) parser
   fixtures so both optimized paths regress visibly.

Measured (release tscheck, per iteration):
- es5.d.ts parse 11.7ms -> 6.1ms (~19 -> ~36 MB/s); full check 15 -> 9.7ms
- dom.generated.d.ts parse 115 -> 60ms; full 170 -> ~100ms
- parserharness.ts parse 44 -> 30ms; full 60 -> 49ms
- generic-heavy check phase 26 -> 19ms
- moon bench parser fixtures -17%..-38%

4. Paren-JSX speculation gated on `allow_jsx` (batch 4): tscheck was
   already extension-driven (`.tsx` only), but THREE paren-path JSX
   attempts (`try_parse_parenthesized_jsx_expr` + the two
   `peek_at(1)==Lt` temp parses in `parse_parenthesized_expr` /
   `parse_primary`) ignored the flag, so every `(<any>x)` cast in a
   `.ts` file ran the full JSX source scan + nested embed sub-parses
   and threw the work away. All three now early-out in `.ts` mode --
   tsc-aligned (`(<T>x)` is a parenthesized type assertion there).
   parserharness.ts parse 30 -> 11ms (44ms pre-round; -75% total),
   full check 49 -> 35ms, byte-identical diagnostics and oracle
   results. `moon bench` cast fixture split into `.tsx`-mode (4.96ms,
   speculation still exercised) and `.ts`-mode (3.51ms) variants.

5. Module-pass allocation hoists (batch 5, check-phase Ir on
   dom.generated.d.ts 552M -> 473M, -14%): `check_structural_duplicates`
   and `walk_module_undeclared_tps` interpolated their diagnostic path
   string (`"interface \{name}"` etc.) once per FIELD/PARAM instead of
   per declaration — hoisted; `walk_module_undeclared_tps` also did a
   linear scan of `method_type_params` per field (quadratic on lib.dom
   interfaces) — now grouped once per interface;
   `check_interface_extends_compat` rebuilt the base interface's
   field/overload-count maps once per (derived, base) EDGE — popular DOM
   bases like `Event` are extended by hundreds of interfaces — now
   cached per base name, and the derived counts hoisted out of the
   bases loop.

Remaining known sinks (next round candidates): `.tsx`-mode JSX
speculation still re-lexes substrings per `<` attempt (only matters
for real `.tsx` sources now); refcount+alloc runtime overhead is
~29% of the remaining check-phase profile and ~25-30% of parse (only
fixable by allocating less); String-keyed Map probes are ~8% of the
check phase spread across all passes (an interned-name or ID-keyed
resolver would be a deep refactor); `Parser::peek/check` +
`TokenKind::equal` are ~30% of body-heavy `.ts` parses (each peek
copies a Token and refcounts its payload; a tag-int fast path would
need parser-wide changes).

## TS Checker Conformance (current state, 2026-09-03 — TypeScript 7)

State: whole-corpus **TP 2518 / MISS 216 / FP 0 / PFLEGAL 0 / TN 1750**
(classified 4484, NOTRUN 14) via
`scripts/checker_conformance_oracle.sh --max-fp 0 --max-legal-parsefail 0`.
Twenty-one batches: BU +9, BV +14, BW +13, BX +10, BY +7, BZ +1, CA +0,
CB +10, CC +6, CD +4, CE +6, CF/CG +19, CH +7, CI +5, CJ +6, CK +3,
CL +11, CM +11, CN +1, CO +4, CP/CQ +28, CR +3, CS +3, for
**+181 TP at FP 0**. MISS <= 250 was met at CO. The goal is now
MISS <= 150, which needs **66 more files** — see batch CS for why that
is not a rule-writing problem any more.

### Batch CS (2026-09-03): three negative results, and an invisible FP

+3 files (TP 2515 -> 2518, MISS 219 -> 216, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0),
checker whitebox 642/642.

**Three mechanisms tested and rejected, which is the useful part.**
Looking for something worth many files rather than one:

1. *Position coverage is not the bottleneck.* A matrix putting a known
   type error in each of 28 syntactic positions (variable declaration,
   call argument, return, property assignment, object-literal field,
   array element, default parameter, later assignment, for-of binding,
   ternary, class field, constructor argument, method return, arrow
   return, index write, spread, template, compound assignment, `as`,
   `satisfies`, `await`, `yield`, destructuring default, object-method
   return, nested object, union context, readonly write, optional call)
   finds **24 already checked**. Only 4 gaps, all small.
2. *A NAME is not a feature cluster.* The 21 `Symbol`-ish miss files
   need 21 unrelated things. Same mistake as the decorator bucket, one
   axis over.
3. *The lib model is largely present.* 8 of 13 common global return
   types infer correctly.

Conclusion: no single mechanism is worth ~66 files, and the measured
rate is ~1.7 rules per file gained.

**The systemic gap that WAS real:** `Symbol()` had no model in
`infer_expr`, so every rule keyed on a symbol operand was silent.
`iterator_class_element_type`'s own comment states it and works around
it locally — another stated abstention naming its own blocker.

**Rules:** TS2358 extended from a syntactic literal LHS to the inferred
type; TS2359 for the right operand; TS2407 for a `for...in` right-hand
side (where `unknown` IS an error, the opposite of the instanceof LHS —
both probed); TS2731 for a symbol in a template substitution (zero
corpus files, kept because `${sym}` throws at runtime); TS18046 for an
unnarrowed `catch (e)`, decided by a token scan where any of five
narrowing spellings withdraws the report for the block.

**The false positive.** `+`, `-` and `~` apply ToNumeric, so the only
type TypeScript refuses is `symbol` (TS2469). `~aString`, `-aString`,
`~aBoolean`, `-aBoolean` and `-anObject` are all legal and were all
reported. Only operator-by-operator probing finds this, because the
BINARY operators DO require a number (`s - 1` is TS2362) and so do
`++` / `--` (TS2356) — the wrong rule looked exactly like its
neighbours. Two tests asserted it by name, the 6th and 7th in this repo
found pinning a bug. And removing it COST a true positive:
`typeArgumentsWithStringLiteralTypes01` was flagged only for
`args[+randBool()]`, idiomatic bool-to-0/1 coercion, while its real
errors are five TS2345s elsewhere. **A conformance file counts as a TP
if we flag it at all, so +1 TP is not evidence that a rule is right.**

### Batch CR (2026-09-03): one fact, recorded at some of its sites

+3 files (TP 2512 -> 2515, MISS 222 -> 219, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0),
checker whitebox 641/641.

- **TS2307 through a re-export.** The check reads `import_module_specs`,
  filled by the IMPORT parsers only, so `export * as ns from './nope'`
  had nothing to report. Routing the eight `expect_from()` sites through
  one `expect_from_spec` fixed half of it — and
  `export { a } from './nope'` still did not report, because this parser
  consumes `from` in TWO ways: a mandatory `expect_from` and an optional
  `match_(From) || match_ident("from")` (since `export { a }` with no
  `from` is legal). Six more sites use the optional spelling. Both
  helpers record through a single `record_module_spec`.
- **An import TYPE's specifier**, a third route, which that arm consumed
  and discarded. Zero corpus files: `importTypeAmbientMissing`'s only
  top-level declaration is a `declare module`, so the whole check is
  suppressed by the ambient-module-bundle gate. Shipped anyway, proven
  in isolation, because a typo in `import("...")` is a real mistake.
- **TS6133 for an unused `#private`**, where a COUNTING argument
  replaces the walk an earlier note deferred on its fail direction. A
  private name is class-scoped, so every read spells `#name`; the number
  of `PrivateIdent` tokens carrying it is therefore an exact upper bound
  on declarations + reads, and not exceeding the recorded declaration
  count means nothing reads it. A missed read is impossible and an extra
  occurrence only silences. File-level on purpose:
  `privateNameUnused` declares `#unused` four times across three classes
  and reads it never, and a `#x in v` brand check is a read.

### Batch CQ (2026-09-03): four rules the compiler had to settle

Verified together with CP: **+28 files** for the pair (TP 2484 -> 2512,
MISS 250 -> 222, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0, TN 1750), checker whitebox 640/640.

- **TS1212** (`yield` / `let` as an identifier reference). The message
  names strict mode and tsc applies it regardless — `yield;`,
  `console.log(yield)`, `var yield = 1`, a parameter named `yield` and a
  bare `let` are all reported at **es5** in a sloppy script. So the rule
  is not gated on strictness or on the target, which is the opposite of
  what the message says and of what batch CF assumed when it reserved
  these names in `parse_binding_ident` for strict mode only. Recorded at
  the two identifier-REFERENCE arms; every property position
  (`{ yield: 1 }`, `o.let`, `interface I { let: string }`,
  `enum E { yield }`, `class C { yield() {} }`) is legal and each is
  parsed elsewhere, which is what keeps the rule off them.
- **TS7008** (a class member with no annotation and no initializer under
  `noImplicitAny`). Recorded in the parser because the annotation is the
  deciding fact and the AST cannot carry it — a missing annotation and an
  explicit `: any` are both `Any`. `q = 1` infers, `r: number` is TS2564
  instead, a `#private` and a `static` member error like a plain one, and
  an ambient class is exempt for free: `declare class` is parsed by
  `parse_declare_class` and never reaches `parse_class_body`.
- **TS2803** (assigning to a private method) and **TS2806** (reading a
  private accessor that has only a setter). Decided over the class body's
  TOKEN range rather than by walking member bodies: a body is an
  arbitrary expression tree, and every access to `#x` must spell `#x`, so
  a token scan is complete by construction where a walker missing one arm
  loses findings silently. A `.` before the `PrivateIdent` is what
  distinguishes an ACCESS from the member's own declaration and from a
  `#x in v` brand check; what follows decides the direction, and a
  compound assignment counts as both — which is why `this.#x += 2` is a
  READ of a setter-only accessor, the corpus shape. Probed: writing a
  set-only accessor is legal, writing a GET-only one is TS2540 (a
  different code, not raised), and writing a plain private field is fine.

### Batch CP (2026-09-03): thirteen rules, one rejection, one perf bug

CP alone was +19 (TP 2484 -> 2503, MISS 250 -> 231, FP 0). Its rules and
findings follow; the pair's combined numbers are above.

**Ranking.** `--miss-list` was added to the oracle so the MISS paths come
out of the same loop that classifies them — a second script deciding what
a MISS is can disagree with the gate — and `scripts/checker_miss_rank.mjs`
probes every one of them with the real compiler and groups by code. It
ranks by `solo` (files where a code is the only lever) rather than by
(file, code) pairs, since the thing that flips is a FILE.

The ranking's first result was a CORRECTION to this document. CLAUDE.md
recorded that TS2322 / TS2345 / TS2339 / TS2304 — the four biggest
buckets — "turn out not to need machinery at all", because their basic
forms are already flagged. Opening the files says the opposite: their
basic forms are already TPs, which is exactly why they are NOT in the
miss list, and what remains under those codes is `for (foo().x of ['a'])`
assigning a string into a property, a well-known-symbol accessor pair,
`Intl.NumberFormat` option types and union normalization. There is no
systemic lever at the top of the table; the work is the tail.

**Ten grammar / lexer / flag rules.** TS1489, TS17006, TS5076, TS1186
(two sites), TS1347, TS17013, TS1036, TS2354, TS18016, TS2390. Each is
described at its site with the probed boundary; the ones worth naming
here are the two that are the applied-in-some-places family (TS1186's two
parsers, TS2390's counter that only ever compared against 2) and TS1036,
which is the INVERSE — `Empty` looks like a missing arm and is a
deliberate abstention, because six legal lowerings produce it.

**Three structural rules.** TS2390, the computed half of TS4113, TS2493.

**TS4113: a recorded rejection, now with a condition.** Batch BY refused
`override` on a computed key as unsound and was right. This ships the
decidable part — a base chain that declares NOTHING cannot declare the
resolved key either — and getting that claim to be TRUE took two fixes:
`resolve_base_chain_members` consulted a merged interface only when no
class of the name existed (which is never, for a merge), and a computed
key in the BASE now sets `has_opaque` so the walk withdraws the claim
rather than reading an unnameable member as an absent one.

**REJECTED (again): wiring `unresolved_type_references` into the
conformance path.** Four causes batch CL named are real and are fixed
(the `__tsmbt_infer` marker read as a type; an `infer` name unresolved in
the branches; a forty-name hand list where the generated
`is_lib_global_type` registry exists; `imported_binding_names` ignored by
`module_declared_name_set` despite its own comment naming the consumer).
None is the blocker. An interface or object-type call / construct
signature's own type parameters are not preserved anywhere `check_type`
can read them, so `interface I { <U>(x: U): U }` reports `U` through arms
the walk has always had — the binder is lost by the PARSER. Adding scope
arms for `GenericFunc` and the mapped types made it worse: those nodes
were previously skipped, and walking them turned silent MISSes into
reports of their own parameters.

**The perf bug.** TS5076 reads the token range its `parse_or` frame
consumed, because parens are stripped. `parse_or` runs once per
expression at that level, nested, so an unconditional scan is O(n^2) in
tokens: a 9 MB file went from seconds to 180+, and the checker whitebox
binary sat at 100% CPU for 36 minutes. Gated on the frame having consumed
a `??`. The oracle's wall time (58 s over 4,484 files) is the check.

### Batch CO (2026-09-03): four one-file rules — MISS 250, the target

### Batch CO (2026-09-03): four one-file rules — MISS 250, the target

+4 files (TP 2480 -> 2484, MISS 254 -> 250, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0, TN 1750).
The goal set for this line of work — TypeScript compatibility at
MISS <= 250 — is met, on the line rather than under it.

All four came out of the long tail the compiler-probed ranking exposed:
67 error codes with exactly one MISS file each, mostly grammar. None
needed type machinery.

**TS4111** — dot access to an index-signature member under
`@noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`. Decided from the interface's
declaration: a string index signature, and `prop` not among its own
fields. Two exclusions, both probed: `Object.prototype` members
(`b.toString`) come from the prototype rather than the signature, and a
declared member alongside a signature (`c.foo` where `C` has both) is a
real property access. An interface with any `extends` abstains, since
only its own `fields` are read and a base's member would otherwise be
reported — a false-positive direction. Its first draft DID ship a false
positive, of a kind specific to this parser: the flag marker landed in
`grammar_misuses` and every non-marker entry there becomes a diagnostic
verbatim, so `<nopropertyaccessfromindexsignature-on>` was reported as
an error on every file carrying the option. Every marker needs an
explicit skip entry.

**TS1207** — decorators on both halves of one get/set pair. Two gates,
and the second is a limitation rather than a rule:

- LEGACY decorators only. Under standard ES decorators each accessor
  gets its own decorator application, so decorating both halves is
  legal — **seven corpus false positives** in `esDecorators/` said so.
  Every probe written for the rule had carried
  `@experimentalDecorators: true`, so not one of them could see it. Same
  gate direction as batch CK's TS1206.
- Class DECLARATIONS only. Inside a class EXPRESSION body the
  decorator-mode flag is not reliable: `(class E { @dec get x() {…} @dec
  set x(v) {…} })` with NO directive fires while the identical
  declaration stays silent, so some parser on that path carries
  `experimental_decorators`' `true` default instead of the
  header-derived value. That is a pre-existing inconsistency affecting
  every decorator-mode-gated rule, so the expression form is skipped
  rather than papered over. It costs nothing here —
  `decoratorOnClassAccessor7` is six class declarations. **Filed:** find
  which constructor supplies the default on that path and thread the
  header value through it.

**TS1249** — a decorator on a bodiless overload signature. Ambient
(`declare class`) and abstract members are excluded, and that exclusion
is where tsc 6.0.3 and the TS7 oracle DISAGREE: 6.0.3 reports TS1249 for
both, and `decoratorInAmbientContext` is TS7-ACCEPTED. Widening the rule
to match the local compiler would have shipped a false positive, so the
probe's answer was the wrong one to follow here — which is the caveat
`scripts/tsc_probe.mjs` states in its own header, now with an instance.

**TS2474** — a CALL in a `const enum` member initializer. A call result
is never a constant enum expression, whatever it returns. Everything else
abstains, and the boundary was entirely probed: legal in a `const enum`
are arithmetic on literals, a shift, a unary minus, a reference to
another member of the same enum (bare or dotted), and a reference to an
outer `const` — which is why a bare identifier and a property access
must not fire, and why `constEnum2`'s own `g = CONST` line is not among
tsc's two reports. `"x".length` IS TS2474 and stays a MISS: telling it
apart from `D.a` needs resolution this does not do. The same call in a
plain `enum` is legal, so the `const` is the whole difference.

### Batch CN (2026-09-03): one rule, and a check whose gate was wrong

+1 file (TP 2479 -> 2480, MISS 255 -> 254, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0). A small
batch, and the interesting part is what probing an EXISTING pair of
checks against the real compiler turned up.

**TS2500** — `class C implements A?.B {}` is not a qualified name. The
diagnostic went where `parse_implements_names` already resyncs, and its
own comment had named the shape it was skipping ("the `?.` of an invalid
`implements A?.B`") — only the report was missing. Note the asymmetry,
which is why nothing was added on the `extends` side:
`class C1 extends A?.B {}` is LEGAL, because an `extends` clause takes an
EXPRESSION, and `classExtendingOptionalChain` says so by accepting the
first half of its own file.

**The TS2610 / TS2611 pair had three problems, and finding them started
from writing a duplicate.** The intended rule — a derived class may not
change an inherited member's kind between a data property and an
accessor — turned out to exist already, so the new implementation was
deleted. Probing the existing one is what paid:

- **The two messages were SWAPPED** relative to their conditions: the
  loop that fires when the base has an ACCESSOR and the derived class a
  property said "defined as a property but overridden as an accessor",
  and vice versa. Detection was right, the text was not. Fixed.
- **The `useDefineForClassFields` gate was WRONG and is gone.** tsc
  reports both codes whatever that flag says — probed with it explicitly
  `false`, which still errors — because the flag changes how a field is
  EMITTED and not whether changing an inherited member's kind is legal.
  Removing it widens the population the pair judges, so it was measured
  on its own: TP 2480 / MISS 254 / FP 0, identical to keeping it. It buys
  nothing on the corpus and it is correct, so it is kept and the number
  is written down at the site. A UNIT TEST had pinned the wrong
  behaviour, with the confusion stated in its own comment ("the property
  flows through the setter -- allowed") — that is an emit fact, not a
  legality one. Third time a test has been found asserting the bug.
- **An AMBIENT class's accessors are invisible to the pair**, and that is
  recorded rather than fixed. The parser upserts a `declare class`'s
  `get x(): T` into `properties` without a `methods` entry carrying
  `accessor: "get"`, so `class_instance_accessor_names` cannot see it.
  That is simultaneously a MISS and a latent FALSE POSITIVE:
  `declare class A { get x(): string }` + `class B extends A { x = 1 }`
  is TS2610 and stays silent (`propertyOverridesAccessors4`), while
  `class B extends A { get x() { … } }` — legal, an accessor overriding
  an accessor — reads as an accessor over a FIELD and IS reported. The
  corpus contains no file of the second shape, which is exactly why
  FP 0 never caught it. The fix is in the parser and would move what the
  bridge generator and `.d.ts` emitter see, so it wants its own change
  rather than a corner of a grammar batch.

### Batch CM (2026-09-03): nine rules, and two things the parser hides

+11 files (TP 2468 -> 2479, MISS 266 -> 255, FP 0, PFLEGAL 0). Nine small
rules, and the two most useful findings are about the PARSER rather than
the checker.

**Where the ranking came from.** `checker_miss_buckets.mjs` reads codes
out of the submodule's TS6-era baselines, which is an approximation and no
answer at all for a file with no baseline. With `scripts/tsc_probe.mjs`
from batch CL there is a better source, so every remaining MISS file was
run through the real compiler under its own harness header and grouped by
the codes it actually produced. That ranking is what this batch worked
from, and it is the reason the rules are so small: the top of the list is
deep type machinery, and the long tail is 67 codes with exactly one file
each — mostly grammar.

**TS2583** (2 files) — `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics` arrive with
`lib.es2017.sharedmemory`, so under an older `lib` they are not declared.
Same shape as batch CH's TS2591 for the `@types/node` names, same reason
for leaving the generated allowlist alone: `is_lib_global_value` answers
"could the platform have provided this", and only name resolution asks
"with THIS lib, did it".

**TS2350** (2 files) — the mirror of batch CL's TS2348. A
call-signature-only type has no construct signature, so `new` over it is
legal in exactly the case the message names, a signature returning
`void`. Provenance is the same argument: `Func` and the `<call>` sentinel
come from a written signature. The return type is what could be wrong, so
`Any` / `Unknown` / `Void` / a `Named` reference all abstain. A top-level
function DECLARATION is excluded by name rather than by inference,
because an old-style JavaScript constructor
(`function Point(x) { this.x = x }`) is exactly that shape and
`new Point(1)` is how such code is meant to be used. `new Symbol()` and
`new BigInt()` get their own arm: they are the two lib functions people
actually get wrong (both throw at runtime) and their types are not
modelled here.

**TS2708** (1 file) — a namespace whose body declares nothing that exists
at runtime is erased, so its name has no value meaning. Two things had to
be got right, and both were wrong first:

- The check has to sit ABOVE every resolution return in
  `check_undefined_name`, and the reason is a property of THIS parser:
  `parser_namespace_lower` lowers every namespace — instantiated or not —
  to `var N = N || {}`, so at script top level the module env and
  `globals` both bind the name whatever the body holds. The first draft
  fired only inside a function, which is where the env holds real locals.
  `ctx.script_top_level` (batch CL) is what tells the two apart.
- An `import a = A` alias COUNTS as a runtime declaration when the
  aliased namespace is instantiated. Missing that shipped a false
  positive on `exportImportAlias` (TS7-ACCEPTED), and the corpus caught
  it — see the parser finding below.

A type-only namespace NESTED in another is not covered, for the same
lowering reason: `export namespace inA { … }` records a value for `inA`.
`importStatementsInterfaces` stays a MISS.

**TS2448** (1 file) — a destructuring default may read a binding declared
EARLIER in the same pattern and not one at or after its own position.
Decided from declaration order alone: no types, no flow analysis. Written
for BOTH pattern kinds, because `const [a = b, b = 1] = xs` is TS2448
just as much as the object form — probed, and it was a MISS before the
generalization. The nested-closure form (`{ e = () => f, f = 1 }`) is
legal in tsc and silent here, so that abstention happens to be exactly
right rather than merely safe.

**TS18038 + TS1107** (2 files) — both class static blocks, and the second
is the label family again. `for await` inside a static block needs no
other condition: `classStaticBlock23` puts the same loop inside an
`async function` to show the enclosing function does not rescue it. And a
static block IS a function boundary, so a label declared outside it is
not a jump target inside it — batch CF's note says fourteen sites in
three files save / clear / restore `self.labels` around a function body,
and this fifteenth one did not, so
`label: while (v) { class C { static { break label } } }` found the outer
label. Clearing them makes the existing "Undefined label" parse rejection
fire, and the corpus file's second class (labels declared INSIDE the
block) is what checks the restore.

**TS1200** (1 file) — a line break before an expression arrow's `=>`. The
restriction is one-sided and was probed rather than assumed: a break
AFTER the arrow is fine, and a TYPE-position arrow may break before it,
which is why `parser_type`'s arrow sites are untouched. It went in as
`Parser::expect_arrow` because expression parsing consumes that token in
EIGHT places.

**TS1002** (1 file) — a string literal reaching a raw line terminator or
EOF. The scanner's catch-all arm consumed ANY character including `\n`,
so an unterminated string silently swallowed the rest of the file — the
same shape as batch CJ's unterminated regex, in the sibling scanner.

**TS2432** (1 file) — in a merged enum, only one declaration may omit the
initializer for its first element. Declaration shape only, and
`is_computed` is what distinguishes "no initializer at all" from "an
initializer we did not fully parse". The grouping key is the namespace
PATH plus the enum name, because the corpus case is three separate
`namespace M` blocks each holding `export enum E1`.

**The parser findings.** Two rules were recorded as values at ONE of the
two places their syntax can appear:

- `export import a = A` inside a namespace body records a type alias and
  no VALUE, while the plain `import a = A` spelling in
  `parse_module_block` records both. That asymmetry is what made TS2708
  false-positive, and the obvious repair — record the value here too —
  was tried, passed the conformance oracle, and was REVERTED by the full
  test suite. The bridge emitter reads `values` to decide what to import,
  and `export import JSX = JSXInternal` over an interface-only namespace
  is a type-only alias that must produce no import at all
  (`type-only-export-import-entry.d.ts`). Whether the alias binds a value
  depends on the TARGET, which is not resolved at parse time, so neither
  answer is right for both consumers: the parser stays as it was and
  `namespace_is_instantiated` takes the fact from `type_aliases`, where
  the export path already records it. That over-abstains for a namespace
  holding only real `export type` aliases — a MISS, not a false positive.
  Worth stating plainly: the corpus said yes and only the suite said no,
  which is the argument for running both.
- The label-stack clearing above is the same shape at the fifteenth of
  fifteen sites.

**REJECTED with measurement: wiring `unresolved_type_references` into the
conformance path.** It is the highest-yield-looking gap on the list —
`type T = Undeclared` and `type T<X> = X extends Undeclared ? … : …` are
both silent while `var q: Undeclared` fires, because an ambient VALUE
declaration reaches the expression checker by another route, and the
function is wired into `check_module` only. Wiring it in produced
FORTY-PLUS false positives, and their shape says why it has to stay
where it is: `check_type` carries one flat `local` list of
type-parameter names, which models a declaration's own parameters and NOT
the binders that appear inside a type — a call or construct signature's
own `<T>`, an `infer A`, a mapped type's key. So
`objectTypesIdentityWithGenericCallSignatures*`, `inferTypes*`,
`thisTypeIn*` and `mappedTypes*` all report their own bound parameters as
undeclared. The narrow version (report only when the type provably
contains no binder) was not attempted: the whole TS2304 solo set is four
files, two of them these type positions, and "provably no binder" is
another guess about the completeness of a list.

**Also measured and not taken:**

- **The permissive filter is not the blocker.** Running the whole corpus
  with it OFF flags 8 of the 277 MISS files at a cost of 49 false
  positives — recorded in batch CL and repeated here because it is the
  fact that decides where to look.
- **TS6133** (an unused `#private` member, 2 files) is deferred on the
  FAIL DIRECTION rather than the effort. Every formulation needs either a
  complete AST walker over the class body or a complete
  reference-recording channel in the parser, and a missed read makes the
  member look unused — that is a false positive, the one direction the
  budget does not allow. The reference mangling happens at four-plus
  sites and sub-parsers carry their own `grammar_misuses` array, so
  "complete" is not something the current shape can promise.
- **TS2403 for two CLASS types** (`var x: C; var x: D`) is silent because
  `structural_named_key` expands a class to its FIELDS and not its
  methods, so `C` and `D extends C { foo() {} }` produce the same key.
  Including methods would need a private/protected abstention (private
  members are nominal, so such a class is identical to no object type),
  and it is worth 1 of the 5 TS2403 files — the other four need `typeof`,
  spread and enum-assignability reasoning.

### Batch CL (2026-09-03): a real compiler as the legal-neighbour oracle

+11 files, and the batch's most durable output is not a rule. Every
"legal neighbour" claim in this repo has so far been an argument;
`node_modules/typescript` holds a real compiler (6.0.3), so
`scripts/tsc_probe.mjs` now runs it over a file the way the conformance
harness would — reading the `// @option:` header — and prints its
diagnostics. It replaces reasoning with a measurement for the two
questions the vendored baselines cannot answer: what TS7 actually SAID
about a file, and what it says about a hand-written neighbour that no
baseline covers. Three of the batch's rules were wrong on their first
draft and the probe is how each was diagnosed. Read its answers with one
caveat, stated in its header: 6.0.3 is not tsgo, so a disagreement with
the TS7 verdict is possible and is itself information — `symbolProperty37`
is in the TS7 error set and 6.0.3 accepts it, which is why
`member_name_duplicates` was left alone (its comment claims duplicate
well-known-symbol interface members merge legally, and against a real
compiler that claim still holds).

**First, the measurement that decided the strategy.** Running every
conformance case with the checker in STRICT mode — the permissive filter
entirely off — flags **8 of the 277 MISS files**, at a cost of 49 false
positives. So the suppression is not what is holding recall back: at most
8 files were behind it, five of them for good reasons (a lib signature's
optional arguments, `toFixed()` with no argument, a `using a = null`
diagnostic that is not the error TS reports). The other 269 files are ones
where the checker computes nothing at all, which is the same conclusion
`docs/checker-priority.md` reached, now with a number instead of an
impression.

**TS2348, three files, and a latent false positive underneath.** Calling
a class without `new` (`Tools.NullLogger()`) needs no inference at all —
a class's static side never carries a call signature, and neither
declaration-merging route can add one — so it is exempt from the
permissive "not callable" suppression for the same reason the
construct-signature-only case is. Carving that subset out exposed what
the filter had been hiding: `is_definitely_not_callable` had an
unconditional `Object(_) => true` arm, so `declare var q: { (): number };
q()` — an object type whose entire purpose is a call signature — was "not
callable". Nobody could see it, because the family was dropped wholesale.
The arm now asks for a `<call>` member. That fix is asserted through the
STRICT entry point, since in permissive mode the wrong answer and the
right one both look silent.

**TS2467 / TS2302, four files, and the same applied-in-some-places
family.** `check_static_uses_class_type_params` read a static member's
return type and parameters, which is where a signature carries types and
not where code does: `static bar() { var obj = { [foo<T>()]() {} } }` is
what real code looks like (computedPropertyNames34), and a static
member's computed KEY is a third position the signature scan cannot see.
Both now use the same predicate the two existing positions use, lifted
over statements. TS2467 is new and cheap because the offending set is the
class's OWN type parameters and nothing else — a type parameter of an
enclosing generic FUNCTION is legal in the same position, and that falls
out of reading `decl.type_params` instead of the ambient in-scope set.

**TS1117 on a well-known-symbol object-literal key, one file, and a
blocker that was written down and wrong.** `record_objlit_duplicate_keys`
skipped every `@@`-prefixed key, and its doc comment recorded
`symbolProperty36` as a deliberate MISS with a reason: only the CLASS key
path resolves a well-known symbol to a stable `@@<name>`, and renaming
the object-literal key would move keys the mangler and the dead-property
pass read. True of the approach it considered, and beside the point — the
parser wraps a computed entry's VALUE as `ComputedProp(key_expr, value)`,
so the key expression was already in hand and nothing had to be renamed.
Second time (after batch BZ) that a stated abstention's own comment named
the thing to remove.

**TS2449 in a class's own computed key, one file.** The class binding is
in its temporal dead zone while the body's computed keys are evaluated,
so a member key may not name its own class. TS2449 already existed for a
forward-referencing `extends`; this is the second position the same dead
zone covers. What keeps it narrow is the legal set, and all of it was
probed rather than reasoned: a static field INITIALIZER (`static q =
C.p`) runs after the binding is initialized, a method body later still,
and another class's name is not this class's dead zone.

**TS2454's lib-global exemption, one file, and a comment that was right
about a scope it did not check.** The exemption's own text says "a
TOP-LEVEL redeclaration of a runtime-provided lib global merges with the
platform value", and the code applied it at every scope. Inside a
namespace or a function, `var Symbol: SymbolConstructor` declares an
ordinary uninitialized local, and tsc reports TS2454 for all three of
`namespace M { … }`, `namespace M { var Object … }` and
`function f() { … }` — probed, not assumed. `CheckCtx` carries
`script_top_level` now, produced by the same `outer_modules.length() == 0`
root test the module-level checks already use.

**Two rules were WRONG in their first form, both caught by the corpus,
and both are the legal-neighbour lesson.**

- **TS2466 for object-literal computed keys is REJECTED**, with the
  measurement kept in the code so it is not re-attempted. The rule exists
  for CLASS member keys, so extending it to object-literal keys reads
  like the same family — and it is not: an object-literal computed key
  may legally mention `super`, and three TS7-ACCEPTED corpus files say so
  (`computedPropertyNames25` / `28` / `31`). It cost **6 false positives
  for 2 true ones**. What makes `computedPropertyNames30` an error is not
  a rule anything here can model: `28` is the same program with the
  object literal directly in the constructor instead of inside an arrow,
  and tsc accepts it. Modelling a distinction one file draws is fitting
  the corpus, so `30` stays a MISS.
- **IIFE arity is one-directional.** Checking a function literal's
  parameter count looked like the same kind of exact fact as a function
  declaration's — the parameter list is right there in the source — and
  checking BOTH directions cost **4 false positives for 1 true one**,
  because TypeScript has a rule that reasoning missed: an IIFE's
  parameters are contextually typed, so passing FEWER arguments than
  parameters is legal and they come out `undefined`.
  `contextuallyTypedIife` says so in a section headed "missing
  arguments" — `((x, y, z) => 42)()` is accepted. Too many is still
  TS2554, which is what `parserNoASIOnCallAfterFunctionExpression1`
  needs.

**Recorded, not attempted:**

- **TS7008** (a class member with no annotation and no initializer under
  `noImplicitAny`) is missing for PUBLIC members too, so it is not the
  usual family — it is simply absent. It stays absent because the parser
  cannot distinguish an implicit `any` from a written `: any` on a class
  property: `type_` is `Any` either way, and `class C { x: any }` is
  legal. `has_initializer` shows the shape of the fix (one more parser-set
  flag), and it touches every `TsClassPropertyDecl` construction site, so
  it is not worth one file.
- **Class EXPRESSIONS reach no class-level check at all.**
  `const C = class<T> { static x: T }` is silent where the declaration
  form fires. Ceiling measured before deciding: exactly **8** of the 266
  MISS files contain a class expression and one of those already flips
  via its declaration form, so it is ~7 files against giving every
  class-level rule a new population to be wrong about.
- **TS4127** (`override` on a dynamic name) is worth 2 files and batch BY
  rejected it as unsound. The probe now says exactly where the line is:
  `const prop = "foo"` keeps a literal type, so the key is late-bindable
  and `override [prop]()` is LEGAL (BY was right), while `let prop =
  "foo"` widens to `string` and is TS4127. A rule keyed on the
  declaration form of the key's binding would be sound; it is filed
  rather than guessed.

### Batch CK (2026-09-03): enum initializers, and one wrong attribution

+3 files, two rules, and a mistake worth more than the files.

**TS1308 / TS1163** — `await` / `yield` in an ENUM member initializer.
The generic await-outside-async check cannot catch these, and the corpus
file says why in its own shape: `enums/awaitAndYield` puts its enum
inside an `async function*`, so `in_async` and `in_generator` are both
true and both operators are legal *there*. An enum member initializer is
a constant-expression position evaluated at compile time, so nothing that
suspends may appear in one whatever the enclosing function is. It hooks
into `scan_skipped_enum_initializer`, which already speculatively parses
the initializer for the string-arithmetic rule and truncates every side
channel afterwards.

**TS1206** — a LEGACY decorator on a `#private` class member. Note the
gate direction: `#private` is rejected by legacy decorators and supported
by standard ES ones, so it points the OPPOSITE way from the `abstract` /
`declare` rule immediately above it.

**That rule cost two corpus false positives before it was right, and the
mistake is one already recorded here twice.** The file that suggested it,
`autoAccessorExperimentalDecorators`, combines TWO features — `accessor`
and `#private` — and gating on either looked equally plausible from the
error code alone. Gating on `accessor` flagged
`decoratorOnClassProperty13` (`@dec accessor prop`) and
`legacyDecorators-contextualTypes` (`static accessor y = 1`), both
TS7-ACCEPTED. The baseline settles it: the file errors on exactly lines
12 and 15, `accessor #a` and `static accessor #b`. The private name was
doing all the work and the auto-accessor none of it. Same substitution as
the `computed_props` terser label and the decorator-bucket ranking:
reading a two-feature file's error as belonging to the feature that
caught the eye first. Dropping the `accessor` half cost nothing — TP 2457
either way.

**TS1186 is left a MISS on purpose**, with the reason in the code rather
than re-derived later: `[...x = a] = a` never reaches the array-PATTERN
parser, because `parse_assignment_binding_pattern` tries
`parse_assignment_target_expr` first and for that source it SUCCEEDS —
the whole bracketed form parses as an expression. Two attempts at the
obvious sites (the rest arm of the pattern parser, and a scan of the
built pattern in `parse_assignment`) both stayed silent because neither
is where the shape lands. One corpus file, so it was not worth a third
guess at the AST shape.

### Batch CJ (2026-09-03): six scanner-level rules, +6 files

Every one of them was a missing case in a loop that already had an exit
for the well-formed shape, and the whole batch lives in `lexer.mbt` plus
five lines of wiring in `parser_core.mbt`, where the existing lexer
counters already become diagnostics.

- **TS1010** ("`*/` expected"): the block-comment skip's `None => break`
  was end-of-file INSIDE a comment and said nothing about it.
- **TS1125** ("Hexadecimal digit expected") for a radix prefix with no
  digits. Three arms — hex, binary, octal — each of which silently
  substituted 0, so the rule existed in none of them. The reason it fell
  through a check that looks like it covers it:
  `invalid_radix_digit_count` answers "a digit outside this radix"
  (`0b2`), which is a different question from "no digits at all" (`0b`).
- **TS1260** ("Keywords cannot contain escape characters"). Only the
  escape path of the identifier scanner can produce one, and the escape
  decodes to a perfectly legal identifier, so nothing downstream had a
  reason to object: `\u0076ar x = 1` scanned as the `var` KEYWORD and
  parsed clean. Keyed on what `classify_ident_or_keyword` returns rather
  than on a name list, so the two cannot drift apart.
- **TS1161** ("Unterminated regular expression literal"): a regex may not
  span a line, and the scanner had no line-terminator case, so `/ b;`
  scanned to end of file and swallowed the rest of it. The newline is
  deliberately not consumed, so the following statements still tokenize.
- **TS1005** ("`)` expected") for unbalanced groups in a regex, counted
  outside a character class only — `/[(]/` is a perfectly good regex.
- **TS1127** ("Invalid character"), narrowed to the Latin-1 symbols and
  punctuation.

The last one carries the only real judgement in the batch. Non-ASCII goes
to the identifier scanner, which over-approximates ID_Continue as "any
code unit >= 0x80" so that `変数` and `π` scan as ONE token — that is
correct, and it is why `¬` (U+00AC, category Sm) parsed clean
(`parserErrorRecovery_Block2`). Without a Unicode table, "not an
identifier character" is exactly what cannot be decided here in general,
so the rule covers the one block where the answer is knowable
(U+00A1..U+00BF plus `×` and `÷`) and excludes the code points in it that
ARE ID_Start — `ª` (U+00AA), `µ` (U+00B5) and `º` (U+00BA) — along with
the non-breaking space and the soft hyphen, which are not errors either.
Everything from U+00C0 up keeps the permissive treatment, so `café` and
`naïve` still scan as identifiers.

### Batch CI (2026-09-03): the operand of an update must be a reference

TS2357 / TS1109, +5 files off one rule. `++this`, `++await 42`,
`--await 42`, `++1` and the `++(++y)` that ASI produces from
`x \n ++ \n ++ \n y` (`parserS7.9_A5.7_T1`) are all rejected by tsc,
and none was flagged.

It rides on `record_assign_target_strict_misuse`, which is already called
at all four spellings JavaScript has for writing a binding (`=`, `+=`,
`++x`, `x++`) — the function batch BU built when `eval++` turned out to be
checked at two of the four. So there is no fifth place to forget.

It is a DENYLIST rather than the complementary allowlist, and that is the
one design decision worth recording. "Flag anything that is not `Var` /
`PropAccess` / `IndexAccess`" is the correct RULE and the wrong
implementation: a target can arrive wrapped in nodes that say nothing
about writability (`TypeArgs`, `As`, `Satisfies`, a `PureCall` marker),
and CLAUDE.md already records three soundness bugs paid for a wrapper
node whose default arm failed open. A denylist fails the other way — an
unlisted shape costs a MISS, not a false positive.

The neighbours that needed pinning are the ones a program actually
contains: `++(x)` (the parser strips the parens, so what reaches the check
is a bare `Var`), `this.x = 1` (a property access on `this` is a place,
unlike `this` itself), `o["k"]++`, `await x++` (the update is the operand
of `await`, not the reverse), and the read-only unary operators.

### Batch CH (2026-09-03): TS2591 and TS2391, +7 files

**TS2591** ("Cannot find name 'X'. Do you need to install type definitions
for node?") is the one rule in this whole run that a working TypeScript
programmer hits regularly. `module`, `require`, `exports`, `process`,
`Buffer`, `__dirname`, `__filename`, `setImmediate` and `clearImmediate`
are NOT part of the default `lib` set — they come from `@types/node` — and
all nine sat in the generated lib-global allowlist, so a `.ts` file using
CommonJS or a Node global with those types missing was accepted in silence.

The allowlist is deliberately left alone. Its seven other consumers ask
"could the platform have provided this name" (the TS2454
used-before-assigned exemption, among them), and for those the
conservative answer is still yes; only `check_undefined_name`
distinguishes the two questions, and it does so only after every
declaration lookup has had its say, so `declare var process`,
`namespace module { }`, an import or a local binding all still resolve.
`global` is excluded on purpose: `declare global { }` is standard
TypeScript and its identifier reaches enough walks that treating it as
undeclared is not worth one file.

**TS2391** ("Function implementation is missing or not immediately
following the declaration") is answered by LOOKAHEAD from the signature —
after a bodyless `function f`, the next declaration must be a function
named `f` — and NOT by carrying a pending run of signature names across
statements. That distinction cost a corpus false positive to learn. The
first version kept the run on the parser and flushed it whenever
`parse_stmt` saw a statement that was not a function declaration, which
includes the statements inside a nested function BODY, because
`parse_function` parses the body through the same funnel. So the legal
three-signature set inside `function other<T …>()` in
`recursiveTypesUsedAsFunctionParameters` — a TS7-ACCEPTED file — was
reported the moment the implementation's own `return null;` was parsed. A
scope-saved field would have had to be threaded through every save /
restore site around a function body; the lookahead needs no scope model at
all.

This also settles half of what this file records as blocked. `TsFunc.body`
being non-optional is a real blocker for anything DOWNSTREAM of the parse,
and TS2393 / TS2394 stay blocked on it — but `last_function_bodiless`
already carries the fact at parse time, so the PAIRING question was always
answerable there. Two declaration arms needed the hook and only one had it
at first: `parse_stmt`'s, and the module loop's own `if self.check(Function)`,
which is why `function data(): string; function next(): string;` stayed
silent while the same pair without return annotations was reported.

### Batches CF + CG (2026-09-02): ten grammar rules, +19 files

Under the goal "MISS <= 250" the ranking from batch BY INVERTS, and that is
worth stating rather than quietly reversing: BY concluded that
`parser/ecmascript5` was the wrong cluster to take, because its 49 files
are `parserErrorRecovery_ParameterList6`-shaped broken syntax nobody
writes. That judgement was correct under the earlier objective, which
weighted real-world encounter frequency. When the corpus COUNT is the
objective, corpus count is what to rank by, and that directory is the
largest and cheapest cluster in the MISS set. Both readings are recorded
here so neither looks like a mistake.

The rules, each one condition next to a rule that already existed:

- **TS1035 / TS1046** — a QUOTED module name declares an ambient external
  module, which only a `declare` context may do. The condition is exact
  rather than approximate: every declare-context caller tests
  `name == "module" && peek_at(1) is Str(_)` and routes that to
  `parse_ambient_external_module_decl*` BEFORE reaching
  `parse_namespace_decl_with_mode`, so a quoted name arriving there is by
  construction non-ambient.
- **TS1213** — a strict-mode reserved word as a binding identifier. The
  22nd instance of this repo's recurring family: the rule was already in
  `parse_binding_ident` for `let` and `yield`, at two of the nine
  spellings the language has, so `class C { constructor(static) {} }`
  parsed clean even though a class body is automatically strict.
- **TS1029** — an accessibility modifier must precede `override`. The rule
  exists for class MEMBERS; parameter properties never got it, because
  `skip_param_modifiers` consumed `override` only to discard it.
- **TS1031** — `declare` may modify a class FIELD and nothing else. Written
  for the constructor alone and stopped there.
- **TS1115** — `continue` needs a label on an ITERATION statement, and the
  existing check only asked whether the label EXISTS; its own comment said
  so ("should be an iteration label for continue"). The kind is encoded in
  the label-stack ENTRY rather than kept in a second array, because
  fourteen sites in three files save, clear and restore `self.labels`
  around a function body and a parallel field would have to be threaded
  through every one — which is the same shape as the family above. A
  prefix rides along through an opaque copy for free.
- **TS1106** — `for (async of x)`. See the false positives below.
- **TS1063 / TS1319** — `export =` and `export default` inside a namespace.
  A namespace body is parsed by a fresh `Parser` that cannot know it is a
  namespace body, so it leaves a sentinel and the enclosing parser decides.
- **TS1155** — a `using` in a C-style for head must be initialized. What is
  LEGAL here came from the baseline rather than from reasoning:
  `for (using of = null;;)` and `for (using of: null = null;;)` are both
  fine, and `usingDeclarationsInForOf.4` errors on its third line alone.
- **TS2852 / TS18054 / TS2853** — where an `await using` is allowed. There
  are THREE declaration sites (a statement, a block-statement, a for-head)
  and the pre-existing TS2854 marker was written at one of them, so
  `{ await using d = null }` inside a block — how every
  `awaitUsingDeclarations` test is written — could never reach it. One
  `record_await_using_context` helper is now called from all three. A class
  static block needed a new `in_static_block` flag because neither
  `in_function` nor `in_async` can say so: a top-level class's static block
  leaves `in_function` false, and a class inside an `async` function leaves
  `in_async` true.

**Three of the ten were corpus FALSE POSITIVES first, and all three are
about a rule's legal neighbour.** TS1106 is a LOOKAHEAD restriction, not a
semantic one — it exists so `for (async of …)` cannot be read as the start
of `for await (… of …)` — so `for await (async of x)` and
`for ((async) of x)` are both legal, and the AST cannot tell the second
from the first because the binding parser strips parens (the token is
checked instead). And `export type R = number` makes a file a module: the
module-syntax evidence set had been assembled from the export shapes that
bind a VALUE, so `usingDeclarationsDeclarationEmit.2` — TS7-ACCEPTED, two
`export type` aliases and nothing else — read as a script. The marker now
sits at the `export` keyword in all THREE export parsers rather than on
the forms that happen to need it, because a marker written at the form is
a marker written at one of them.

Two fixes came along that are not conformance rules. The statement-level
`async function` arm cleared `in_async` to `false` instead of restoring it,
so an enclosing async body went non-async the moment it declared a nested
`async function`; `parse_function` reads that flag to learn whether the
function it is parsing is async and saves/restores it around the body
itself, so the site only has to hand it the answer. And the RUNTIME export
parser recorded no `<export-default>` marker at all, so the TS2528
multiple-defaults count could not see a default export in a `.ts` file.

### Batch CE (2026-09-02): TS1048, TS1434, TS1196, TS1368

Six files, four rules, each of which was one missing condition:

- **TS1048** ("A rest parameter cannot have an initializer") — the 21st
  instance of the family and the closest yet: TS1047 ("a rest parameter
  cannot be optional") sits on the adjacent line and asks about `?` where
  this asks about `=`.
- **TS1434** ("Unexpected keyword or identifier") for a repeated `static`.
- **TS1196** — a catch clause annotation must be `any` or `unknown`. The
  annotation was already parsed here, and discarded; only the comparison
  was missing.
- **TS1368** ("Class constructor may not be a generator") — legal at every
  other member name, which is what the test pins.

### Batch CD (2026-09-02): TS2449, TS5061, TS1117

Four files, three rules, each self-contained:

- **TS2449** ("Class 'X' used before its declaration"): a class whose
  `extends` clause names a class declared LATER in the module. A class
  binding is block-scoped and its heritage clause runs at declaration time,
  so the later name is still in its temporal dead zone — unlike a function
  declaration, which hoists. An AMBIENT class on either side is exempt, and
  that exemption was found by probing rather than by reasoning:
  `class C1 extends C2 {} declare class C2 {}` is ordinary @types layout
  and fired before it was added, because a `declare class` emits nothing and
  asserts the binding exists from elsewhere — declaration order in a `.d.ts`
  carries no runtime meaning. An interface base is also exempt (a type, no
  runtime binding), and an out-of-module or expression base abstains because
  the order is not visible.
- **TS5061** ("Pattern 'X' can have at most one '*' character") for a quoted
  ambient module name. Counting is the whole rule: one `*` is the legal
  wildcard form, none is an ordinary specifier.
- **TS1117** ("An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the
  same name"), at the single site where the field list is complete. Three
  shapes are legal rather than abstained-from: a `get x` / `set x` PAIR
  (the parser keys them `@@get:x` / `@@set:x`, so comparing prefixed keys
  gives that for free), a SPREAD (which may legally supply a key another
  entry overrides — `{ ...o, a: 1 }`), and a computed key.

  A FOURTH was missing and shipped as a false positive: `{ … }` in
  expression position is a COVER GRAMMAR, an object literal only until an
  `=` follows, at which point it was an object destructuring PATTERN all
  along and duplicate names in it are legal. `({ foo, foo } = { foo: 2 })`
  was reported. Two things about how it was found are worth keeping. The
  ORACLE could not see it: `destructuringSameNames` contains illegal
  spellings too, so the file was a TP whichever half fired, and the run
  reported FP 0 with the bug present. The UNIT SUITE caught it, because an
  earlier batch had written those three legal shapes down as cases — which
  is the argument for pairing every rule with its legal neighbour in a
  test rather than trusting the corpus count. Gating on `not(self.check(Eq))`
  at the call site costs nothing: TP 2443 / MISS 291 / FP 0 before and
  after.

`symbolProperty36` (`{ [Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: 0,
[Symbol.isConcatSpreadable]: 1 }`) is left a MISS on purpose and the reason
is written into the code: the object-literal parser stores a computed key as
`@@computed:<index>`, so two of them never compare equal, and only the CLASS
key path resolves a well-known symbol to a stable `@@<name>`. Giving object
literals the same naming would change keys the mangler and the
dead-property pass read — too much blast radius for one file.

**TS2403 was the biggest bucket (12 files) and is not worth 12.** Its
simple spelling already works (`var x: number; var x: string;`), so the
files were opened. `unionTypeEquivalence` needs TYPE IDENTITY rather than
assignability — `var x: C; var x: C | D;` errors even when `D extends C`,
and the same file's `var y: string|number; var y: number|string` and its
`typeof`-aliased `z1` pair must stay silent, so it needs order-insensitive
identity plus `typeof` resolution for ONE file. The other eleven need real
inference of an un-annotated second declarator (`var t: this; var t = …`,
`var x: never; var x = []`, spread inference, generic signature
comparison). Third time this session that a code count promised a batch and
delivered one file; the fix is the same as the first two — open the files.

### Batches CB / CC (2026-09-02): the goal changed, so the ranking did

Everything above was ranked by cost AND real-world frequency, and on that
basis `parser/ecmascript5` — the largest and cheapest cluster at 49 files —
was explicitly the WRONG one to take, because its files are
`parserErrorRecovery_ParameterList6`-style broken syntax nobody writes.
With the objective restated as a corpus number, corpus count IS the
objective and that judgement inverts. Both are recorded so neither reads as
a mistake: they answer different questions.

**CB (+10): the `using` declaration family, plus three one-site rules.**
`is_disallowed_lexical_stmt_start` rejects `let` / `const` / `class` /
`function` / `async function` in a single-statement position and had NO
`using` arm — which is TS1156 exactly ("'using' declarations can only be
declared inside a block"). Seventeenth instance; `using` reached the parser
after that check was written. Both spellings gate on the same look-ahead
the statement parser uses, so a plain identifier reference named `using`
(`if (c) using;`) is untouched. With it: TS1155 (must be initialized —
visible only because `parse_var_decl_list_from` substitutes the
`__ts_no_init__` sentinel, so `init` has no `None` case), TS1493/1494 (a
`using` head in `for…in`, keyed on `is_in` because `for (using x of …)` in
the same branch is legal) and TS1547/1548 (a `case` clause body, checked by
peeking at the statement about to be parsed rather than by carrying a flag —
a clause body is a statement LIST, so where we stand answers the
enclosing-block question, and `case 1: { using x = d; }` reaches
`parse_block` instead).

Three more, each an existing check that covered some of what it named:
`check_getter_returns_value` read `module_.classes` only, so TS2378 missed
`var v = { get Foo() { } }` — the object-literal spelling its own doc
comment names (`parserAccessors3`, `parserES3Accessors3`). Restricted to an
EMPTY body, which is why none of that check's abstentions (a `throw`, a
loop, a bare `return`) need repeating, and shared between the two
object-literal accessor parse paths because TS1054/TS1049 are written out
at both. The ten predefined-type names were written out for classes AND for
type aliases and not for interfaces (TS2427) — and the coverage LOOKED
partial for a reason that is not a rule: `number` / `boolean` / `string` /
`void` have dedicated lexer token kinds so `interface string {}` cannot be
parsed at all, while `any` / `unknown` / `never` / `bigint` / `symbol` /
`object` arrive as ordinary identifiers and sailed through. And TS2505 (a
`void`-annotated generator) went into the async return-type helper, which
already took `is_generator` as its exemption — same question, does the
declared return type contradict the function's KIND.

**CC (+6): duplicate names in one destructuring pattern, and two for-head
rules.** TS2451 for `let { foo, foo }` / `let [v, v]`, placed in
`parse_var_decl_item` so every declarator of a group passes it, plus the
for-of head. `destructuringSameNames.ts` is the legal-neighbour list
written by the TypeScript team and is asserted verbatim: `let { foo, foo:
bar }` binds two DISTINCT names, and every assignment-pattern repeat
(`({ foo, foo } = …)`, `[foo, foo] = …`) is legal because an assignment
target is not a declaration — those parse as expressions and never reach a
binding parser, so they are excluded structurally rather than by a test.
`var` merges, so the caller has to say which keyword it parsed and
`is_block_scoped` has no default. Also TS2481
(`for (let v of []) { var v }`, reading only the body's own flat `var`
statements so a nested block falls through) and TS7022 for the DIRECT
self-iterable (`for (var v of v)`), the indirect inference-cycle cases
(`for-of33`/`34`/`35`) abstaining.

**One false positive of my own, and it is the twentieth instance of the
family this document catalogues.** The TS7022 rule shipped without a
`no_implicit_any` gate and reported four TS7-ACCEPTED files:
`for (var of of of) { }` and `for (var of in of) { }`
(`parserForOfStatement18`/`19` and their ES5 twins) bind a variable named
`of` and iterate one named `of` — a genuine self-reference that tsc stays
silent about under `@strict: false`. Every other `<noimplicitany>` recorder
in the parser gates on that flag. Caught by the oracle, not by reasoning,
which is the argument for running it per batch rather than per round.

And the stale-binary trap landed a third time, in the opposite direction:
after the gate fix only the RELEASE binary was rebuilt, so a debug probe
reported the FP as still present and a test assertion written from that
probe was wrong. Rebuilt, all 26 assertions of the new test match the
checker. CA's zero is deliberate and explained in its own
section — the diagnostic it adds is one the conformance suite does not
exercise and real code hits constantly.

### Batch BY (2026-09-02): rank by MACHINERY, not by code

The ranking the miner shipped with was by error CODE, and a code is not a
difficulty class — this document already records that mistake for
`computed_props`, `loops`, `typeofs` and `sequences`. Two refinements, both
cheap, and each changed what the list said to work on.

**1. Rank by FILE, not by (file, code).** A file flips MISS -> TP as soon as
we flag ANY error in it, so the bucket table double-counts: a file carrying
five codes inflates all five. `checker_miss_buckets.mjs` now prints `solo`
(files where this code is the ONLY lever — the guaranteed yield) beside
`total`, plus a greedy cover answering the question a batch actually asks.
The head is TS2322 30 total / 15 solo, TS2345 20/10, TS2339 18/7,
TS2304 15/4, and the best twelve rules together reach only 33% of the
MISSes — the tail is genuinely long.

**2. Those four buckets are NOT missing machinery.** Probing the simplest
spelling of each settled it in one command: `const x: string = 1`,
`f(1)` against `f(a: string)`, `o.b` on `{a: 1}`, and a bare
`nonexistent;` are ALL already flagged, at six assignment sites, three call
sites and four property sites. So `docs/checker-priority.md`'s "only large
type-machinery features remain" is wrong a second way — the machinery
exists and something specific defeats it in those files.

**3. Re-bucketing by FEATURE beat re-bucketing by code.** `symbolProperty*`
spans TS2403 / TS2420 / TS2353 / TS2454 / TS2464 / TS2320 / TS2554 — seven
codes, one feature, invisible to a code-keyed cover. Grouping the 351 MISS
files by conformance directory gives `parser/ecmascript5` 49,
`statements/VariableStatements` 20, `classes/members` 16,
`decorators/class` 15, `es6/Symbols` 15, `es6/destructuring` 12,
`es6/for-ofStatements` 12.

**And the two axes conflict, which is worth stating rather than smoothing
over.** `parser/ecmascript5` is the biggest cluster AND the cheapest class
(grammar), but its files are `parserErrorRecovery_ParameterList6`-style
broken syntax nobody writes — high corpus count, near-zero real-world
frequency. Using the corpus count as a proxy for "what users hit" is the
same label-for-objective substitution recorded above. The batch was picked
from the intersection instead: declaration-level rules (no type inference)
over constructs real code contains.

The legal-neighbour probe ran BEFORE any implementation, mechanically,
against all 1750 TS7-accepted files. It rejected more than it approved:

| rule | TN files that TS7 ACCEPTS | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| decorator on `#private` | **7** (`esDecorators-*`) | REJECTED |
| private setter, no getter | 1 (`privateNameSetterExprReturnValue`) | REJECTED |
| decorator on a static block | 0 | implemented |
| decorator on `import X = …` | 0 | implemented |
| `override` + computed name | 0 | REJECTED anyway — see below |
| `super` with type arguments | 0 | implemented |

Landed (+7 TP, attributed by diffing the miner's per-file verdicts —
6 files flipped, 0 regressions, then +1 more after the `TypeArgs` fix):

- **TS2335 / TS2337 — `super` at every class body site (4 files).** The
  check EXISTED, with its helper, its message and its FP-safety argument,
  and read only `decl.constructor_body`. A class body holds code in eight
  places; `super.foo()` in an ordinary METHOD of a heritage-free class
  parsed clean. **Thirteenth instance** of one rule applied to some of the
  sites it names. Fixed as one function over the whole `TsClassDecl` that
  enumerates every body-bearing field, so a new field is a visible omission
  in one place. `implements` is deliberately not heritage here (it brings no
  base constructor), which is why the condition is `base_names` /
  `base_expr` and not the parser's `class_decl_no_heritage`. TS2337 reuses
  the same walker through a `SuperRefKind` parameter rather than a second
  copy — see the TS2466 entry for why that mattered.
- **TS1206 — decorator on a static block / on `import X = …` (2 files).**
- **`TypeArgs` hid `super<T>(0)` (1 file).** `parserSuperExpression2` did
  not flip with the rest, and the reason is the one CLAUDE.md predicted in
  writing: "twice that a wrapper node's fail-open default has cost a
  soundness bug, and the reason to expect a third." This is the third.
  `super(0)` fired, `super<T>(0)` reached `_ => false`. A sweep of every
  checker walker that peels a value-preserving wrapper found two more gaps
  (below) and no others.
- **Five parser diagnostic channels were dead inside a namespace.**
  `namespace N { eval = 1 }` and `namespace N { @dec var z }` recorded
  their diagnostic and had it dropped. Cause: `parameter_property_misuses`,
  `strict_mode_misuses`, `invalid_decorator_uses`,
  `param_optional_initializer_misuses` and
  `interface_member_modifier_misuses` sat inside an
  `if outer_modules.length() == 0` block. That guard is correct for exactly
  ONE thing it wrapped — `deprecated_compiler_options`, a file header — and
  was inherited by the rest; a later workaround re-drained
  `grammar_misuses` from namespaces instead of fixing it. Fifteenth
  instance, with a twist: not one rule written twice, but one item's
  correct condition applied to six that do not share it. Now one
  `parser_channel_issues(module_)` called for every module.

  **Correction to my own reasoning while doing this**: I expected a large
  yield, on the theory that every rule from batches BU–BX was disabled
  inside namespaces. Measured, it is **+1 file** on the corpus, because
  most of those rules route through `grammar_misuses`, which the workaround
  already covered. The value is the bug class, not the count — the same
  shape as BX's export-namespace finding, which the corpus also could
  barely see.
- **TS2466 had a SECOND hand-written `super` walker**, and it was a strict
  subset of the shared one: no arm for `Spread`, `PureCall`, `TypeArgs`,
  `Await`, `As`, `Satisfies`, `Cond`, any of the three assignment forms,
  `New`/`NewExpr`, or `Call(_, args)`. That last one is reachable —
  `[f(super.m())]`, `super` in an ordinary named call's argument. Deleted
  and delegated rather than patched arm by arm, since patching is what
  produces the pair.
- **`collect_expr_value_names` lost bindings under three wrappers.** It
  answers "which names are DECLARED", so a missing arm makes a later
  reference read as undeclared — the FALSE-POSITIVE direction, the one with
  a zero budget. `f<T>(function g() {…})` hid `g`.

REJECTED with evidence, not deferred for lack of time:

- **TS4127 (`override` on a computed name, 2 files).** Flagging every
  `override [k]()` is FP 0 on the corpus and UNSOUND on legal code.
  `overrideLateBindableName1`'s own baseline names only `Base3` — with
  `const prop = "foo"`, `class D extends B { override [prop]() {} }` is
  legal when `B` declares `[prop]`, because a `const` string is
  late-bindable. Our `class_key_name` folds only literal EXPRESSIONS, so
  `[prop]` and `[dynamicLet]` are the same `"<computed>"` node; separating
  them needs declaration resolution. "FP 0 on the corpus" is not soundness,
  which is the whole reason this is written down.
- **TS1029 on a parameter property (1 file).** The modifier-order rule
  already exists for class MEMBERS, including its `override` arm;
  `skip_param_modifiers` consumes `override` and discards it. Fourteenth
  instance — but the right fix is to unify the two, not to write the order
  out a third time, and unifying widens the member rule (it would newly
  reject `static declare`, `abstract` orderings) and so needs its own FP
  measurement. Filed rather than half-done.
- **TS1206 on a `#private` member (2 files).** Legal under standard ES
  decorators — 7 TS7-accepted files rely on it. The parser DOES know the
  mode (`experimental_decorators`), so a gated rule is ~5 lines, but it
  reads a corpus DIRECTIVE and real code sets the flag in tsconfig, which
  the parser does not read. Real-world value ≈ 0.
- **TS2806 (private accessor with no getter, 1 file).** Not a declaration
  rule at all: the error is at the USE, and `this.#x += 2` (reads) versus
  `this.#x = v` (does not) is the distinction. Same family as the
  `x += 1` -> `x++` bug recorded above.
- **`typeOfThisInStaticMembers9` stays a MISS by design.** Its errors are
  `function`-expression and class-expression boundaries inside a DERIVED
  class, where a sibling arrow on the same class is legal. The walker
  refuses to descend into either, which is what keeps the 11 TS7-accepted
  object-literal-`super` files clean; separating the boundaries needs a
  per-boundary rule rather than a mention test.

One tooling fix: `checker_miss_buckets.mjs` had the same stale-binary trap
`checker_conformance_oracle.sh` had last round — it preferred RELEASE
unconditionally while `moon build --target native` produces DEBUG. It picks
the newer build now and prints which, like the oracle.

### Batch BZ (2026-09-02): TS2420 never checked whether a member is PRESENT

TP 2390 -> 2391, MISS 344 -> 343, FP 0 / PFLEGAL 0 / TN 1750.

**Read that +1 before reading anything else, because the estimate was 5.**
The TS2420 bucket holds 5 MISS files and the batch was sized from that
number. Only ONE of them is the missing-member form (`symbolProperty25`);
the other four raise TS2420 for unrelated reasons — private-member
incompatibility through interface merging (`mergedInterfacesWithInherited
Privates`, `…2`), overload assignability
(`stringLiteralTypeIsSubtypeOfString`), a numeric indexer
(`subtypingWithNumericIndexer5`). This document already records "an error
CODE is not a difficulty class" for `computed_props` and the decorator
cluster; this is the same mistake made about YIELD instead of difficulty,
and the fix is the same — open the files.

The reason to ship it anyway is the reason the corpus cannot show: adding a
member to an interface and forgetting to implement it is what a person
actually does, and the conformance suite has almost no cases of it because
it was written to exercise the type system, not to reproduce everyday
mistakes. Same shape as batch BY's namespace-channel fix, which was also
worth one corpus file and a whole class of product-facing bug.

Found by applying batch BY's own method (probe the simplest spelling) to the
next two buckets down. `check_class_implements` checks the TYPE of members
that are there; it did not check that they are there at all:

| source | tscheck |
|---|---|
| `interface I { a: number } class C implements I { }` | **0 issues** |
| `interface I { a: number } class C implements I { a: string = "x" }` | 1 |
| `interface I { m(): void } class C implements I { }` | **0 issues** |
| `interface I { m(a: number): void } class C implements I { m() {} }` | **0 issues** |

This one is NOT the "rule applied to some of the sites it names" family, and
saying so corrects a characterisation made before the code was read. The doc
comment stated the abstention and its reason in writing: "a *missing* member
is deliberately not flagged (it may be inherited from a base class we don't
fully thread here)". A documented abstention with a stated blocker, not an
oversight. The work was to remove the blocker.

`resolve_base_chain_members` does that. The walk already existed inside
`check_override_modifiers` — generic base, expression base, multiple bases,
out-of-module base and a lowered-class interface that extends something all
set `resolvable = false` — so it was extracted rather than rewritten. Both
consumers ask a question whose wrong answer is a false positive ("no base
declares this `override`" / "no base supplies this interface member"), so
`resolvable == false` must abstain in both, and a second copy of such a walk
is the last thing this file needs: the two `super` walkers that had drifted
apart were fixed in the same session.

The legal-neighbour surface is where the work was, and scanning the accepted
corpus beat imagining cases. Exactly 9 TS7-ACCEPTED single-file cases carry
`class … implements`, and every one is accounted for:

| file | why it stays silent |
|---|---|
| `mixinAbstractClasses` | `abstract` class (and implements it anyway) |
| `mixinAbstractClassesReturnTypeInference` | same |
| `accessorsOverrideProperty9` | `abstract class MixedClass … implements` |
| `symbolProperty23` | well-known-symbol key, `@@toPrimitive` on both sides |
| `ExportClassWhichExtendsInterfaceWithInaccessibleType` | parameter properties, inside a namespace |
| `parserSyntaxWalker.generated` | `implements` only inside comments |
| `everyTypeWithInitializer` | member declared |
| `throwStatements` | member declared |
| `assignmentCompatWithObjectMembers3` | required present, other member optional |

Two of those shapes — the symbol key and the namespace-scoped parameter
property — were absent from the case list written from first principles, and
only the scan produced them. A third route was found by re-reading rather
than probing: **class / interface declaration merging**. `class C implements
I {}` beside `interface C { a: number }` is legal and the interface supplies
the member; `.d.ts` files pair a class with a same-named interface routinely,
and this pass runs on them, so missing it would have false-flagged correct
bridge input. `check_class_interface_merge_modifiers` in the same file shows
the repo already knew the shape.

Abstains, each because a member could arrive from somewhere not enumerated:
an `abstract` class (a subclass may supply it — and zero baselines in the
whole TypeScript corpus raise TS2420 on an abstract class), a class with an
instance index signature, an unresolvable base chain, an OPTIONAL interface
member (optionality arrives as `T | undefined`, so a required
`T | undefined` abstains too — the safe direction), and a computed name.
Inherited interface requirements (`interface I extends J`) are not
collected, which loses a finding and cannot invent one. A STATIC member does
not satisfy an instance requirement, and that fires.

`TS2430` (interface incorrectly extends, 6 files / 2 solo) was probed at the
same time and is FINE at the simple spellings — wrong property type, wrong
method type and optional-vs-required all fire. Its MISSes are elsewhere.

`TS2739` / `TS2740` ("Type X is missing the following properties") is the
same presence question asked of a VALUE, and needs NO work: it already
fires at all five sites probed — a variable initializer, a call argument, a
return, a type-literal target, and a fully-empty object literal — with the
optional-property and all-properties-present neighbours correctly silent.
Class-side presence was the only missing half.

### Batch CA (2026-09-02): the duplicate-declaration family was absent

**Zero corpus files, and the reason is stated below rather than discovered
afterwards.** TP / MISS / FP / TN all unchanged at 2391 / 343 / 0 / 1750.

Probing the next codes down found not a gap but a hole:

Sixteenth instance of the family, and this one is visible in the check's own
doc comment. `check_function_var_duplicates` walks `module_.top_level_stmts`
matching `Var(Ident(n)) | Let(Ident(n)) | Const(Ident(n))` and compares the
name against `module_.funcs` AND NOTHING ELSE — the loop, the pattern and
the message were all already there, and the declarations were never compared
against each other. The comment says "only the function-vs-binding pair is
flagged" and gives two reasons: `var`+`var` merges, and function overloads
legally repeat a name. **Neither reason reaches `let`+`let`** — a second
`let` is not a merge and not an overload — so the comment justifies
excluding two shapes and then excludes a third silently.

Deliberately NO scope walk. Only the flat `Ident` forms of
`top_level_stmts` are read, so `{ let x } { let x }` never reaches the check
(an inner `let` sits inside a `Block` statement the match does not descend
into), a destructuring pattern falls through, and a `for` head is a
different statement; the layered walker already calls this per namespace
body. Every omission loses a finding and cannot invent one, which is the
right direction and the reason not to reach for the binder-form walk this
repo has paid for seven times.

The corpus yield is 0 because all four in-bucket files are outside that
stated scope, checked by opening them rather than assumed:
`destructuringSameNames` is `let { foo, foo: bar }` (a duplicate inside one
destructuring pattern), `for-of52` is `for (let [v, v] of [[]])` (an array
pattern in a `for` head), `autoAccessor11` is class auto-accessor members,
`localTypes4` is local TYPE declarations inside functions.

Shipped anyway, and the standard applied is the repo's own. #84 / #87 / #95
were rejected because measurement showed they did not achieve their stated
purpose. This one does — 7 firing spellings, 11 legal neighbours silent, all
probed against the real checker — and what the number says is that the
conformance suite does not contain the shape, exactly as with batch BX's
export-namespace false positive (corpus byte-identical, real product bug)
and batch BY's namespace channels (+1). Before this, `mtsc` type-checking
ACCEPTED `let x; let x`, a program tsc rejects.

TS2393 ("Duplicate function implementation") is NOT attempted, with a
mechanical reason: `TsFunc.body` is not optional, so an overload SIGNATURE
and an implementation are indistinguishable from `module_.funcs` — the
neighbouring `check_overload_void_return` has to guess "the last
declaration is the implementation" for the same reason. TS2394 ("overload
signature not compatible with its implementation") is absent entirely and
blocked on the same fact.

One instrumentation note, because it looks like a contradiction and is
not. `moon test` prints a SECOND accuracy line from
`parser_typescript_wbtest.mbt` — `precision=411/414
(false-positives=3)` — while the gate above says FP 0. Both are right:
that harness is a loose catastrophe net (20% cap) over a pinned 31-directory
subset, it decides "clean" from the presence of a **TS6-era**
`.errors.txt`, and unlike the gate it counts multi-file cases and files
tsgo never ran. The three are `assertionTypePredicates2` (multi-`@filename`,
which TS7 does error on) plus `classWithStaticFieldInParameter{Initializer,
BindingPattern}.3` (both NOTRUN under TS7), and all three are batch BE's
TS2373 parameter-scope diagnostic, not this round's. Checked rather than
assumed — the first explanation offered ("TS6/TS7 divergence") was measured
and came back ZERO files, which is why the real cause is written down here.

**The MISSes are ranked now, and the strategy doc was wrong.**
`scripts/checker_miss_buckets.mjs` (`just checker-miss-buckets`) classifies
every single-file case in parallel, caches the per-file verdict, and buckets
the MISSes by the error codes in the submodule's baselines. Its totals are
cross-checked against the oracle — a miner that disagrees with the gate is a
broken miner, and that had to be visible rather than assumed. The verdict
(errors / accepts) comes from the vendored TS7 manifests; only the bucket
LABEL comes from the TS6-era baselines, which is an approximation and is
documented as one. A MISS with no baseline file lands in `NOBASE` rather
than being dropped.

The answer contradicts `docs/checker-priority.md`, whose conclusion —
"増分的な sound recall win は枯渇" — was measured against the **TS6** oracle
in June:

- **128 of the 388 MISS files are flippable by a pure-grammar (TS1xxx)
  rule.** No assignability, no flow narrowing, no generic instantiation.
- **91 of them have baseline codes that are ALL TS1xxx**, i.e. not one type
  judgement is needed anywhere in the file.

Batch BX (2026-09-01): TP 2373 -> 2383, MISS 361 -> 351, FP / PFLEGAL 0.
Ten files, and one of them was a gap in a check that already existed.

- **TS1169 / TS1170** — a computed property name in an interface (1169) or
  a type literal (1170) must refer to a literal type or a `unique symbol`
  (7 files). A denylist of three token shapes at bracket depth 0: an
  assignment (`[a = 0]`), a binary operator (`["" + ""]`), and a call's `(`
  that is not the first token. That last condition is what separates
  `[foo<T>()]` from `[(e)]`, a parenthesised reference, which is legal.
  Every legal key was probed and none matches — a string or number
  literal, a bare identifier over a `unique symbol`, a dotted const-enum
  reference, a template literal, a well-known symbol. The rule is
  interface / type-literal ONLY: a CLASS computed key and an OBJECT
  LITERAL computed key both take an arbitrary expression
  (`class C { ["" + ""]() {} }` is clean tsc), so it is deliberately not
  recorded from the class member parser.
- **TS1046 for namespaces** (2 of 3 files). `check_dts_top_level_modifiers`
  already existed and already flagged functions, enums, classes, variables
  and executable statements — and skipped NAMESPACES, so
  `parserModuleDeclaration{2,4}.d` sat as MISSes against a check written
  for exactly them. Eleventh instance of a rule applied to some of the
  forms it names.

  Opening it exposed a TWELFTH instance in the same family, one layer
  down, and this one was a false positive aimed at the PRODUCT rather than
  a missing diagnostic: `export namespace X { }` recorded no
  `<export-value>` marker, while every other exported declaration kind
  (function, enum, class, variable) does. So an exported namespace read as
  un-exported and TS1046 flagged it — and `export namespace` is ordinary
  @types shape, which is the bridge's primary input. The conformance gate
  could not see it (the corpus has almost no `.d.ts` files); the UNIT TEST
  written for the new namespace arm did, on its second assertion. Fixed
  where the model says it belongs — an exported namespace IS an exported
  value — rather than with a namespace-only marker, and measured: the
  oracle is byte-identical at TP 2383 / FP 0, so widening that channel had
  no blast radius on the corpus.

  Two premises were checked rather than assumed while fixing it, because
  the comment written first asserted one of them. `module_.namespaces` does
  hold ONLY the top level (`namespace M { namespace M1 { } }` in a .d.ts
  reports one issue, not two), so an ambient outer namespace exempts its
  children for free. And the failing assertion was identified by RUNNING
  each form through the real `.d.ts` path — `declare` 0, `export` 1,
  bare 1, `declare global` 0 — not by counting characters in the failure
  span, which had pointed at the wrong line. `parserModuleDeclaration1.d` (`module "Foo" { }`) stays
  a MISS: a QUOTED specifier arrives through `module_augmentations`, which
  carries no `declare` flag, so telling `module "Foo" {}` from
  `declare module "Foo" {}` needs a new channel for one file.
- **TS1132** — an enum member is expected after a comma (1 file). A
  TRAILING comma is legal and cannot reach the check, because the
  separator after a parsed member is consumed at the bottom of the member
  loop and the next iteration sees `}`; a comma reaching the TOP of the
  loop never had a member before it. Only the comma: `enum E { A; B }` is
  TS1357, a different rule.

Measured while chasing a suspected regression in this batch, and worth
recording because it is NOT one: `tscheck` on
`typescript/src/compiler/checker.ts` (54,434 lines) splits **268 ms parse /
45,392 ms check** in a release build — the checker spends 170x the parser's
time on one file, and the full `moon test` sweep of `typescript/src` in a
DEBUG build is what makes the checker whitebox test run for tens of
minutes.

That it is not a regression from this round was settled by A/B rather than
by argument: the pre-batch commit built in a git worktree gives **45,327 ms
on checker.ts against 44,243 ms** for the current tree — identical within
noise. Two hypotheses were offered before that measurement and both were
wrong. A quadratic in `record_suppressible_grammar_misuse`, whose
`grammar_misuses.contains(…)` scan runs per recorded misuse: checker.ts
records ZERO grammar misuses. And the 64-token lookahead the computed-key
rule adds per bracket-headed member: `peek_at` is O(1) and the whole parse
half is 268 ms. The checker's own cost on large single files is unmeasured
beyond this data point and is a separate question from conformance recall.

DEFERRED from this batch, with the reason: **TS1063** (`export =` inside a
namespace, 1 file) needs a namespace-depth counter the parser does not
have. **TS1338** (`infer` outside an `extends` clause, 2 files) needs
conditional-type context tracking, and both target files are large and
dominated by TS2322 / TS2344 anyway.

Batch BW (2026-09-01): TP 2360 -> 2373, MISS 374 -> 361, FP / PFLEGAL 0.
Thirteen more files, and the batch's own boundary probes are the substance
of it — every rule below has its LEGAL neighbour recorded next to it,
because "fires on the corpus file" and "does not fire on the legal
spelling" are two different claims and only the second one is what keeps
the gate at zero.

- **TS1051 / TS1052 / TS1053 / TS1094 / TS1095** — the `set` accessor
  family (5 files): a parameter with an initializer, an optional
  parameter, a rest parameter, a return-type annotation, and (for BOTH
  accessor kinds) a type-parameter list. `set F(v: number)`,
  `get F(): number` and `set F(v,)` are the legal neighbours and stay
  silent.
- **TS1016 / TS1047** — parameter-list rules (3 files), recorded in
  `parse_params`, the ONE site every parameter list goes through, so a
  method, a plain function, a constructor and an arrow are covered by
  construction rather than by four copies. Two legal neighbours matter
  here and a naive reading gets both wrong: a DEFAULT does not make a
  parameter optional for TS1016 (`f(a = 1, b)` is legal tsc) and a REST
  after an optional is fine (`f(a?, ...b)`).
- **TS1064** — an `async` function's return annotation (2 of 4 files).
  The rule is nearly syntactic — tsc requires the GLOBAL `Promise<T>`, so
  even `PromiseLike<void>` and a `Promise` SUBCLASS are errors — but a
  type ALIAS to `Promise<void>` is legal, and the alias and the subclass
  are the same named-annotation node at parse time. Every named
  annotation therefore abstains, which costs the two
  `asyncQualifiedReturnType` files (`X.MyPromise<void>` stays a MISS) and
  is the right direction for a 0-FP gate. Deciding those two needs the
  declaration table (a name declared in-file as a class or interface
  cannot be an alias) and is filed, not built.
- **TS1013** — a rest element with a trailing comma (1 file), binding
  patterns only. The PARAMETER form is deliberately not implemented:
  `declare function f(...a,)` is ACCEPTED by tsc in an ambient
  declaration, and the parser cannot express that exemption (see the
  TS1212 note below for the same blocker). The binding-pattern form has
  no ambient spelling, so it needs no exemption.
- **TS1097** — an empty `extends` / `implements` list (2 files). Tested as
  "the body `{` opens immediately" rather than as "the collected name list
  came back empty", because an empty list is ALSO what the collector
  returns for a legal form it cannot spell (`interface I extends
  import("m").T`), and blaming the author for a gap in the collector is a
  false positive by construction.

The round's one false positive is the reason the async rule has an
`is_generator` parameter: `types.asyncGenerators.es2018.1.ts` is
TS7-ACCEPTED, an `async function*` returns `AsyncGenerator<Y, R, N>` rather
than a promise, and the rule does not apply to it at all. Caught by the
gate on the first run, before the batch landed.

Batch BV (2026-09-01): TP 2346 -> 2360, MISS 388 -> 374, FP / PFLEGAL 0.
Fourteen files, two clusters, and one instructive failure in the middle.

- **Constructor cluster** (6 files): `static` / `async` / `override` on a
  constructor is TS1089, a type-parameter list is TS1092 (an EMPTY one,
  `constructor<>()`, is additionally TS1098 — so the check has to ask
  whether a list was WRITTEN, not whether it produced names), and a
  return-type annotation is TS1093 for every annotation including `void`.
  Accessibility modifiers are deliberately absent from the list: tsc
  accepts `private constructor()`, the singleton idiom. `abstract` and
  `readonly` are errors too but under their own codes (TS1242 / TS1024)
  and are left alone — a check that reports the wrong rule is worse than
  no check.
- **Index-signature cluster** (8 files): TS1017 (rest parameter), TS1019
  (question mark), TS1021 (no value annotation), TS1096 (not exactly one
  parameter), TS1268 (parameter type not `string` / `number` / `symbol` /
  template literal).

The instructive part: the first draft wrote the index-signature rules
INLINE in the type-literal member parser and won **2 of the 8** files.
A type literal (`type R = { … }`) and an interface body are parsed by two
near-duplicate member loops in different files, so `{ [k: any]: V }` was
checked and the identical `interface I { [k: any]: V }` was not — the same
family this file has recorded ten times, caught here by the corpus rather
than by reading. The rules are three shared helpers now
(`record_index_signature_shape_misuse` /
`_key_misuse` / `_missing_annotation`) called from both loops, and the
unit test asserts every shape in BOTH spellings so a future edit cannot
regress one and still pass.

TS1268 is decided by a DENYLIST of the primitives tsc rejects rather than
by the complement of the four it accepts, and the reason is a genuine
ambiguity rather than caution: `type K = string; { [k: K]: V }` is LEGAL
and `{ [k: RegExp]: V }` is TS1268, and both are the same named-type node
here. Abstaining on every named type costs `RegExp` (a MISS) and keeps the
alias (no FP). Unions abstain too (`{ [k: string | number]: V }` is
legal), and a literal key is a different rule entirely (TS1337).

Batch BU (2026-09-01): TP 2337 -> 2346, MISS 397 -> 388, FP / PFLEGAL 0.
Nine files, three rules, and the first one was a BUG before it was a recall
item:

- **TS1100** (`eval` / `arguments` as an assignment target, 4 files).
  JavaScript spells that target four ways — `eval = 1`, `eval += 1`,
  `++eval`, `eval++` — and the rule had been written twice, at the two
  assignment spellings, with nothing at either update. `"use strict";
  eval++` parsed clean. Tenth instance in this repo of one rule written in
  several places and applied in some, so the fix is one helper
  (`record_assign_target_strict_misuse`) called from all four rather than a
  third and fourth copy. The strict gate came off as well: tsc reports
  TS1100 for `eval = 1` in a plain script with no prologue and no flag
  (probed), and the oracle errors on both `-negative` files, so the gate was
  silencing half the corpus cases on top of the missing spellings. Ambient
  declarations are the one exemption tsc makes
  (`declare function f(eval: number)` is clean) and are unreachable from an
  assignment position; BINDING positions keep their own gate.
- **TS1101** (`with` statement, 3 files — including
  `arrowFunctionContexts`, which the bucket labels could not name because it
  has no TS6 `.errors.txt`). Unconditional: TypeScript rejects `with` in
  every configuration.
- **TS1114** (duplicate label, 2 files). `self.labels` was already scoped
  exactly the way the rule is — pushed on entering the labelled statement,
  popped on leaving, and saved/cleared/restored at every function-body parse
  site — so the check is one `contains`. The two TS7-ACCEPTED neighbours
  prove it rather than merely not-contradict it: sequential labels
  (`duplicateLabel4`) and a re-use inside a nested function
  (`duplicateLabel3`) both stay clean.

The `with` rule found the one false positive in the round, and it is worth
recording because it is a general constraint on every grammar check added
from here: `topLevelVarHoistingCommonJS.ts` is TS7-ACCEPTED and its
`with (_)` is preceded by `// @ts-ignore`. Our issues carry no line
positions, so file granularity is the only FP-safe reading — the same choice
the TS2465 / TS1166 family already made — and both new statement-level rules
go through `record_suppressible_grammar_misuse`.

Two tooling defects came with the round, both of the "my own harness was
lying to me" kind this file keeps recording. The oracle preferred the
RELEASE binary unconditionally and printed nothing about its choice, while
`just verify-checker-soundness` builds DEBUG — so a release binary left from
an earlier session silently won, and six target files "did not change"
because the harness was running code from before the change. It picks the
newer build now and prints which. CI never saw it: a fresh checkout has
neither binary until the recipe builds one, which is exactly why it
survived. And `moon check --deny-warn` cannot be used as a gate here at all
(451+ pre-existing warnings); plain `moon check` with `0 errors` is the
check.

DEFERRED with the reason, not attempted: **TS1212 / TS1213** (reserved word
as a binding name). All nine strict-reserved words are TS1212 even in a
sloppy script (probed), and the existing gate at
`parse_binding_pattern` covers only three (`interface` / `let` / `yield`);
adding the other six would win 2 files (`parser642331`, `parser642331_1`).
It is NOT worth it yet, for a product reason rather than a corpus one:
`declare function f(static: number)` is clean in tsc and
`function f(static: number)` is TS1212, so the rule needs an ambient
exemption the parser cannot currently express (`in_ambient_module` is a
whole-parse mode; there is no per-declaration flag), and getting it wrong
false-flags npm `.d.ts` files — the bridge's primary input. Two files
against a new FP channel in the product is the wrong trade. The corpus
itself carries no counter-example: the one accepted file matching a
reserved-word binding (`parserSyntaxWalker.generated.ts`) has all its
matches inside comments.

Also deferred: **TS1115** (`continue` to a non-iteration label, 1 file).
Needs iteration-ness per label, which `self.labels` does not carry, and
adding a parallel stack means mirroring the save/clear/restore at 12+ parse
sites — the exact shape of the bug family above. The right implementation is
a post-parse AST walk over `Label(name, body)` / `Continue(Some(name))`,
which is ~40 lines for one file; worth doing after the cheaper buckets.

## TS Checker Conformance (2026-07-17 — TypeScript 7, superseded above)

react joined the real-world gate as the 21st package (2026-07-18):
`package|react|react|` resolves types through @types/react, the bridge
emits a 3,898-line surface (83 types / 58 functions / 117 structs), and
the smoke tests exercise createElement / isValidElement / createRef /
version end-to-end on react@19.2.4 (both the in-package test and the
build-smoke main). Budgets calibrated from measured metrics (JSValue
functions 30, cause split 129|43|8|24|34|14|6, unsupported exports 0);
policy budgeted-fallback alongside preact until a dedicated
JSX/component binding layer exists.

JSX/component layer v1 (2026-07-19): a MoonBit closure IS a React
function component at runtime, and the generated react bridge now ships
the glue to use it typed. When the module spec is exactly `react`, the
ffi emits `element_of_component[Props]((Props) -> JSValue, Props?,
Array[JSValue]) -> JSValue` (React.createElement over a MoonBit
closure) and `use_state_typed[S](S) -> (S, (S) -> Unit)` (useState as a
generically-typed value/setter pair; the setter re-enters React through
the captured dispatch). Proven end-to-end in the gate: a counter
component defined entirely in MoonBit -- `use_state_typed(41)` +
`createElement("div", ...)` -- mounts via `element_of_component` and
`react-dom/server`'s renderToString returns `<div>41</div>`. The
injected layer adds zero JSValue-metric regressions (react budgets
unchanged); react's fallback policy note now records the layer.
Remaining for v2: typed intrinsic-element props (attribute structs),
useEffect/useReducer typed wrappers, preact parity, and a react-dom
corpus entry. Oracle unchanged (TP 2338 / FP 0 / TN 1750).

Flagship-callable round (2026-07-19): three surface gaps closed and ws
joins the gate (42 packages + 10 node builtins = 52 entries). (a) ws
interop: cjs-module-lexer misses CJS alias re-exports, so the glue's
named class bindings now fall back through sibling aliases of the same
runtime entity -- statically-known siblings from the export surface
plus `const Y: typeof X` value aliases (`const Server =
__ts_mbt_module.Server ?? __ts_mbt_module.WebSocketServer`); a
noServer WebSocketServer constructs and closes from MoonBit. (b) Call
signatures on VALUE exports surface as callable module functions: the
richest `<call>` signature of a const's inline object type or Named
interface emits under the export's own name --
`minimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo", None) -> Bool` and chalk's
`default(...) -> String` now work directly. (c) Overload variants that
differ only in RETURN type survive wrapper emission: the base-signature
skip compares against the export's actual base (not `preferred[0]`),
the "wider" disqualifier only applies against same-return picks, and
`undefined`-typed parameter slots get a suffix -- uuid's `v4():
string` emits as `v4_version4_options_optional_undefined_number_optional`
and generates+validates a real v4 at smoke time. The broader
push_preferred collapse stays param-count-keyed (loosening it regressed
the React fixture's namespace-member naturalization). Budgets
recalibrated for uuid / valibot / immer / superstruct / lodash.
Oracle unchanged (TP 2338 / FP 0 / TN 1750); moon test 2523/2523.

Top-download expansion (2026-07-19): eight of npm's most-downloaded
packages verified end-to-end and added to the real-world gate (41
packages + 10 node builtins = 51 entries): axios (getUri asserted
against baseURL+url config), commander (option parse --debug ->
opts.debug), debug (enable/enabled/disable + logger factory), chokidar
(FSWatcher construct + close), pino (logger level from options),
lodash (camelCase / kebabCase / chunk -- 435 declared functions from
the fixed reference-following + value-interface surface), uuid
(validate / version after the glue fix), minimatch (filter matcher
after the segfault fix). ws deferred: cjs-module-lexer does not expose
its `Server` alias as an ESM named export, so the generated static
binding is undefined at runtime -- needs interop-tolerant class
bindings (same family as the node:* tolerance) before it can join.
rxjs / ajv / undici structurally healthy (method-surface heavy),
queued as budgeted-fallback candidates.

Default-export / export= naturalization (2026-07-18): the two
structural gaps behind the probe's weak surfaces are fixed and the
corpus grew to 33 packages. (a) Module resolver: a raw `.js` "main"
no longer shadows tsc's implicit package-root `index.d.ts` lookup in
Types mode (deepmerge ships index.d.ts with `"main": "dist/cjs.js"`
and no `types` field -- the whole declaration surface was erased);
resolution now retries declaration-ish results first, then root
index.d.ts, then the raw script as last resort. (b) Export semantics:
`TsModuleBlock.has_export_equals` records CJS `export =`, and
`resolve_imported_binding_export` forwards a namespace import binding
(`import X = require("./sub")` / `import * as X`) through the target's
`default` export when the target uses `export =` -- X IS the assigned
entity, so `export { X as valid }` re-export chains (@types/semver's 42
per-function files, @types/picomatch) now surface callable typed
functions instead of `get_*() -> JSValue` getters. Results: semver 97
callable externs (valid/clean/major smoke-tested), picomatch callable
`default(glob) -> Matcher` (match/non-match smoke), deepmerge callable
`default` merge (both-keys smoke) -- all three added to the gate with
calibrated budgets (33 packages + 10 builtins = 43 entries green).
Oracle unchanged (TP 2338 / FP 0 / TN 1750), moon test 2523/2523.

Corpus expansion round 2 (2026-07-18): nine more npm packages verified
end-to-end and added to the real-world gate (30 packages + 10 node
builtins now): ms, nanoid, dayjs, qs, yaml, superstruct, eventemitter3,
mitt, marked -- each with a runtime bridge smoke that calls a real API
and asserts the result (ms "1m", nanoid length, dayjs format, qs
parse/stringify, yaml roundtrip, superstruct assert/validate,
eventemitter3 on/listenerCount, mitt on/emit handler count, marked
"# hello" -> <h1>). Two real-package bugs found by the probe and fixed:
(a) parser -- `export default function mitt<T>(...): U;` (bodiless named
default in a .d.ts) crashed the module-block path at the missing `{`;
named defaults now route through the declaration parser like the
checker path already did; (b) bridge -- the .mbti fn-decl line parser
used `rev_find(")")` for the parameter-list close paren, which grabs the
RETURN type's paren when a value getter has a curried function type
(marked's `get_use_` emitted unparseable MoonBit); it now depth-scans to
the paren matching the open. Probe leftovers documented: semver / 
picomatch / deepmerge surface as JSValue-only or empty (default-export
function naturalization gap), tracked as a future bridge target. Oracle
unchanged (TP 2338 / FP 0 / TN 1750); corpus react pin moved to 19.2.7
(react-router peer floor).

Batch BX (2026-07-18): @types/react@19.2.17 audit — 13/13 files parse
clean and the declaration bodies check clean; the only reports were
TS2307 module-resolution complaints for imports that DO resolve on disk
(`csstype` is a declared dependency of @types/react, `./` is the
package-root self-import in jsx-runtime). tscheck now resolves module
specifiers against the filesystem for files living under node_modules
(relative specs probe the usual `.d.ts` / `index.d.ts` candidates; bare
specs walk up to `node_modules/<pkg>` / `node_modules/@types/<pkg>`)
and suppresses TS2307 when the import resolves. Conformance corpora
live outside node_modules, so the oracle is unchanged (TP 2338 / FP 0 /
TN 1750); truly-missing modules inside node_modules are still flagged
(verified by negative control). All three real-world declaration
surfaces are now fully clean: lib.d.ts 108/108, @types/node 88/88,
@types/react 13/13. `ts2mbt decl` emits a 3,135-line MoonBit surface
from @types/react (useState and the hook family included). The
rwcorpus package.json now pins every gate package (plus @types/react
and @types/express) so `npm install` no longer prunes them.

Batch BW (2026-07-17): lib.d.ts / @types/node checker issues driven to
ZERO — 108/108 lib files and 88/88 @types/node files check fully clean.
Fixes: (a) the type-param-arity check learned MINIMUM arity — the parser
records `<generic-min-arity>NAME=K` (leading params without a default)
at every generic declaration site, ambient `declare module` / `declare
global` sub-parses propagate the suppression-only sentinels to the outer
module (they were parsed by a fresh Parser and lost), and `check_arity`
flags under-application only below the minimum (`Iterable<T, TReturn =
any, TNext = any>` legally takes 1..3 args; TokenForOptions likewise) —
this replaced an unsound exact-arity rule that also cost 4 lucky TPs
(conditionalTypes1 / inferTypes1 / recursiveMappedTypes /
varianceAnnotations under-apply LEGALLY and were flagged for the wrong
reason; TP 2342 -> 2338, FP still 0); (b) interface accessor syntax
(TS 5.4 `get x(): T` in interfaces, lib.es2024/lib.dom) parses as a
readonly-property pair; (c) interface-extends member compat exempts
generic methods (CallableFunction.call), covariant Named returns via the
extends chain (getElementById), optional-over-required when the derived
member is `any` (BeforeUnloadEvent.returnValue), optional-method
overload duplicates (Process.send), and tuple members whose elements
narrow covariantly through the extends chain (http2
ClientHttp2SessionEventMap `stream`: ClientHttp2Stream extends
Http2Stream); (d) TS2307 abstains in `declare global` bundles
(fetch/streams/undici-types) and for node builtin subpaths
(`stream/web`); (e) arity check tolerates type-param defaults declared
only via merged declarations (min across duplicates).

Batch BV (2026-07-17): driving the BU-audit residuals down —
lib.d.ts 569 -> 14 issues (103/108 files clean), @types/node 41 -> 14
(80/88 clean); oracle unchanged (TP 2342 / FP 0 / TN 1750). Fixes:
(a) interface-extends member compat now skips OVERLOADED members —
tsc compares the whole overload set, and the pairwise entry comparison
misfired 464 times on lib.dom's `addEventListener` specialization
pattern alone; (b) `check_type_undeclared_tps` skips callable members
of object-literal types (the parser discards signature-level type
params there — Process.finalization's `register<T>`), and accumulates
method type params across ALL same-name overload entries instead of
letting the last overload win (lib.dom `querySelector<K>`/`<E>`);
(c) TS2307 abstains for `node:*` / classic Node builtin specifiers and
inside ambient-module declaration bundles. Remaining residuals (28
total): timers' `RefCounted` cross-scope refs, lib.dom accessor-pair
`get`/`set` duplicate-identifier misparse, type-param DEFAULTS in the
arity check (TokenForOptions), CallableFunction/Function member compat,
undici-types cross-package import.

Batch BU (2026-07-17): full-surface parse audit of `typescript@6.0.3`
`lib*.d.ts` (108 files) and `@types/node@26.1.1` (88 files): 196/196
parse clean (0 parse errors); `@types/node` emits substantive decl
surfaces (fs 459 / crypto 552 / util 106 MoonBit decls), `lib.*` files
are global ambient scripts with an intentionally empty export surface.
Checker false positives found by the audit and fixed (all
`declare module "spec" { ... }` body exemptions — the parser flattens
those bodies into the parent module without ambient flags): TS1046
top-level-modifier (197 hits in fs alone), TS2564 strict-property-init
(util's MIMEType), and the trailing-void overload heuristic (crypto's
randomInt / verify). After the fixes @types/node checks 69/88 files
fully clean (41 residual issues, mostly interface-generic `T` scoping
and cross-file globals); lib.d.ts residuals concentrate in lib.dom
(482 of 569, deep DOM hierarchy modeling limits). Oracle unchanged
(TP 2342 / FP 0).

Batch BT (2026-07-17): TP 2341 -> 2342, MISS 393 -> 392, FP / PFLEGAL
still 0. Class-expression member bodies no longer inherit control-flow
narrowing: the parser lowers `class { ... }` expressions to a `<class>`
IIFE, and `check_funcexpr_with_context` now rebinds captured variables at
their DECLARED types for that marker — class members execute after the
guard region, so tsc does not narrow into them (typeGuardInClass).

Batch BS (2026-07-17): TP 2338 -> 2341, MISS 396 -> 393, FP / PFLEGAL
still 0. Mining the TS2322 cluster (30 files, 17 single-code): (a) a
concrete primitive assigned to an opaque generic indexed access
(`tp: T[P]; tp = s`) is always TS2322 — matches both the raw
`IndexedAccess(Named(T), _)` annotation and the bound-substituted
`IndexedAccess(_, Keyof(...))` shape parameter registration produces
(nonPrimitiveConstraintOfIndexAccessType); (b) `x: T & U` with
union-of-primitive constraints is bounded by the member-set intersection
of the bounds — a target union missing one of the members rejects it
(intersectionWithUnionConstraint, plus one multi-code file). Assessment
of the remaining TS2322 files: functionExpressionContextualTyping2 /
contextuallyTypeCommaOperator02 / typeGuardInClass (class-expression
narrowing reset) / callChain.3 / objectLiteralNormalization /
typeFromPropertyAssignment31 look feasible next; generatorTypeCheck8
(iterator protocol compat), symbolProperty46 (symbol-keyed accessors),
conditionalTypesExcessProperties, templateLiteralTypes7 need deeper
machinery.

Batch BR (2026-07-17): TP 2333 -> 2338, MISS 401 -> 396, FP / PFLEGAL
still 0. Bodiless generator declarations (`declare namespace M {
function *g(): any }`, generator overload signatures, bodiless `*m()`
class methods) are always-error grammar misuses recorded at parse time
(generatorInAmbientContext2/4.d, generatorOverloads1/2/3);
`Constructor(...)` joined `is_definitely_not_callable` (a
construct-signature value called without `new` is TS2348 — inference
doesn't reach it for the remaining corpus cases yet, but the predicate
is sound). Remaining 396 MISS is a long tail (top cluster TS2322 at 30,
71 files with TS7-only baselines).

## TS Checker Conformance (current state, 2026-07-12, superseded above — TypeScript 7)

The oracle now correlates against **TypeScript 7** (typescript-go
v7.0.2). Truth comes from vendored name manifests
(`scripts/ts7_baselines/`, see its README); case files are the
`typescript` submodule at typescript-go's `_submodules/TypeScript` pin
(`4d4f005c`). TS7 removed the ES3/ES5 targets — every `target=es5/es3`
variant is NOTRUN, and the TS6-era deprecated-compiler-option
diagnostics (TS5107/TS5101) were removed from the checker accordingly.

State: whole-corpus **TP 2335 / FP 0 / PFLEGAL 0 / TN 1750 / MISS 399 /
NOTRUN 14** via `scripts/checker_conformance_oracle.sh --max-fp 0
--max-legal-parsefail 0`. Batch BR emptied the legal-parse-failure
budget (decoratorOnClass3, defaultExportWithOverloads01, parser768531)
and the gate now enforces 0.

Batch BE (TS7-only miss mining, +51 TP) worked the misses newly exposed
by the oracle switch:
- TS5102: `downlevelIteration` was REMOVED in TS7 — its presence-based
  recording now surfaces as an error (every ran conformance case
  carrying the directive errors under tsgo; none is accepted).
- TS2378: a class `get` accessor whose body contains NO return, throw,
  or loop must return a value (empty bodies parse as `body: None`;
  ambient / abstract accessors and any explicit `return;` abstain — a
  written `(): any` is indistinguishable from no annotation).
- TS1206: decorators on constructors flag in both modes; on `abstract` /
  `declare` members only under STANDARD decorators (legacy mode accepts
  them — decoratorInAmbientContext); parameter decorators flag only
  without `@experimentaldecorators` and only when the decorator chain's
  last follower is not `class` (a paren'd decorated class expression
  enters the arrow-params trial — esDecorators-classExpression-*).
- TS2373/TS2372: a parameter default (or binding-pattern computed key /
  element default, or class-expression heritage inside one) may not
  reference the parameter itself, a later parameter, or a body-declared
  name (`var` hoisted anywhere, `let`/`const` top-level). Nested
  callables defer evaluation and abstain. Covers module functions,
  class constructors/methods, top-level callable initializers, and
  IIFE arrows.
Sweep round-trip: the first BE sweep surfaced 10 FPs (bare-return
getters, legacy-mode ambient decorators, stacked decorators before
class expressions); all root-caused and fixed before landing.
Batch BF (+19 TP, TP 2222 / MISS 512) continued the mining:
- TS2465/TS1166: `this` in a class member's computed property name
  (direct refs only — nested callables rebind), and computed FIELD keys
  through a declared-`any` call (no literal type — autoAccessor5).
  Whole-file abstention when the source carries `@ts-ignore` /
  `@ts-expect-error` (the parser pushes a `<ts-suppression-present>`
  marker; our issues aren't line-anchored, so file granularity is the
  FP-safe choice — esDecorators-classDeclaration-outerThisReference).
- TS1125/TS1198: `\u{...}` escapes in STRING literals — missing /
  non-hex digits and values past 0x10FFFF (accumulator clamped against
  32-bit wrap). Template literals deliberately NOT counted: tagged
  templates accept invalid escapes (ES2018) and the lexer can't see
  taggedness.
- TS1121: legacy octal integer literals (`01`).
Batch BG (+11 TP, TP 2233 / MISS 501) closed the escape-sequence
remainder:
- Regex `\u{...}` under the `u` / `v` flags: `scan_regex` collects the
  body and `validate_regex_unicode_escapes` requires hex digits and a
  value within 0x0..0x10FFFF (accumulator clamped against 32-bit wrap).
  Without the flag, `\u{2}` is a quantified `u` and stays legal.
- Untagged-template invalid `\u` / `\x` escapes (incl. overflow): the
  lexer records each escape's source position in
  `template_invalid_escape_positions`; the parser counts entries inside
  the Template token's span at the UNTAGGED primary parse site only —
  tagged templates accept invalid escapes (ES2018) and parse through
  the postfix path. Escapes inside `${...}` interpolation sub-parses
  are lost (sub-parser array discarded) — a known miss, not an FP.
- Strings additionally validate `\x` (exactly two hex digits).
Batch BH (+9 TP, TP 2242 / MISS 492) implemented TS2683 —
implicit-any `this` — as a dedicated context-tracking walker
(`check_implicit_any_this` + `ts2683_walk_expr/stmts`):
- IMPLICIT contexts: plain function declarations/expressions without a
  `this` parameter (including ones nested in methods and static-field
  initializer function exprs), namespace top-level statements (a
  namespace body is an IIFE), and class-declaration decorators inside
  namespaces.
- TYPED/EXEMPT contexts: methods/accessors/constructors at their top
  level, arrows (inherit), object-literal FUNCTION values (contextual),
  function exprs in CALL-ARGUMENT position (callee may declare `this` —
  esDecorators-contextualTypes.2), property/index/compound-assignment
  RHS (`Element.prototype.remove ??= function () {…}` —
  thisPrototypeMethodCompoundAssignment), ANNOTATED binding
  initializers, `<class>`-named IIFE lowerings of class expressions,
  true top level (`globalThis`), and `this`-parameter functions.
- Opt-outs: `@noImplicitThis: false` (new `<noimplicitthis-off>`
  marker), `@strict: false`, and the `@ts-ignore` whole-file marker.
Permissive-path only. One stale wbtest pin (`this` in a method-nested
function expr expected 0) was updated to the TS7 verdict.
Batch BI (+24 TP, TP 2266 / MISS 468) took the small syntactic
clusters from the general miss pool:
- TS1049/TS1054: a `set` accessor takes exactly one parameter, a `get`
  accessor none — recorded at the parse sites for both object-literal
  accessors (both parse paths) and class accessors.
- TS1031: `export` / `declare` cannot modify class elements (incl.
  `declare constructor`). The `export` arm consumes the token only in
  MODIFIER position via `can_consume_class_modifier` — `class C {
  export; }` declares a field NAMED export
  (propertyNamesOfReservedWords went PFLEGAL until guarded).
- TS1124: a numeric exponent needs at least one digit (`1e`, `1e+`).
- TS2466: `super` cannot be referenced in a computed property name —
  member chains and `super()` inside comma chains
  (computedPropertyNames24/27). computedPropertyNames30 stays a MISS:
  strada raises TS2466 for `this` in an object-literal computed key
  inside a typed constructor arrow, which our typed-context model
  deliberately treats as legal.
Batch BJ (+12 TP, TP 2278 / MISS 456) took the TS2454/TS2488/TS2403
type clusters:
- ASI vs declaration heads: `namespace` / `module` head a declaration
  only when the NAME sits on the same line (`is_namespace_decl_start`
  rejects a newline-separated follower), and a statement-level `declare`
  with a line break after it is a plain identifier reference (TS's
  modifier ASI rule). `namespace\nn\n{}` is then three statements whose
  reads hit the existing TS2454 unassigned tracking
  (asiPreventsParsingAsNamespace01/02,
  asiPreventsParsingAsAmbientExternalModule01).
- TS2488 beyond class instances (`check_forof_non_iterable`): a for-of
  source that is a non-iterable primitive (`for (const v of 0)`), a
  union with a non-iterable primitive member (`string | number`), or an
  object type whose `[Symbol.iterator]` member is OPTIONAL; plus an
  array-destructuring pattern over a primitive element type
  (`for (var [a = 0] of [2, 3])`, syntactic array-literal sources only).
  The optional-iterator case rides a new parser encoding: STANDARD
  well-known `[Symbol.x]` keys in object-type literals parse as `@@x`
  members instead of degrading the whole literal to `any`
  (user-augmented `Symbol.foo` keys keep the legacy fallback —
  symbolProperty61 FP'd until restricted).
- TS2403 vs lib declarations (`check_lib_global_redeclaration`): a
  script-level initializer-less `var` redeclaring a runtime global
  (`var Symbol: any` / `{ iterator: string }`) must carry the matching
  `*Constructor` interface annotation; module files and `typeof`
  annotations abstain (ES5SymbolProperty3/4/7 vs ES5SymbolProperty1).
Batch BK (+11 TP, TP 2289 / MISS 445) mixed scoping, parser-recovery,
and call-modeling slices:
- Block scoping in the TS2304 hoisting backstop: a `let` / `const`
  for-of/for-in head is LOOP-scoped (only `var` heads hoist —
  for-of7), and an assign-form loop's body contributes only `var`s
  (`for (v of xs) { let v; }` cannot declare the head — for-of6).
  Closures inside the loop still see the head binding via the env walk.
- `new Date<A;`: type arguments are only consumed when a balanced `>`
  exists; otherwise the cursor restores and `<` parses as a comparison,
  so `A` surfaces through the normal undefined-name path
  (parserConstructorAmbiguity1/2/4).
- TS2345: `f.apply(x, arguments)` where `f` is a zero-parameter
  function — `IArguments` is never assignable to the empty tuple `[]`
  (asyncArrowFunctionCapturesArguments_es5/es6/es2017). Functions WITH
  parameters abstain.
- TS1005: reserved-word and literal object-binding shorthands need a
  `: alias` (`var { while } = …`, `var { "while" } = …` —
  objectBindingPatternKeywordIdentifiers01/03), and `void` cannot head
  a qualified type name (`var v: void.x` — parservoidInQualifiedName1).
Batch BL (+7 TP, TP 2296 / MISS 438) worked the TS2339 cluster:
- Object patterns over PRIMITIVE for-of elements flag their props
  (`for (var {x: a = 0} of [2, 3])` — ES5For-of27/29; prototype members
  like `toString` stay legal), mirroring BJ's array-pattern TS2488.
- An object sub-pattern under a REST element draws its keys from the
  array surface: non-numeric keys outside `array_prototype_member` (+ a
  small always-legal extra set) flag on Array/Tuple sources, in both
  declaration and assignment forms (restElementWithBindingPattern2,
  restElementWithAssignmentPattern2/4).
- The pattern-vs-object-literal key check (parser AND checker copies)
  now folds spreads of syntactic object literals recursively instead of
  abstaining (`const { g } = { ...{ ...{ c: 0 } } , f: 0 }` —
  destructuringSpread); getter/setter entries provide their names.
- `new SharedArrayBuffer(...)` keeps its Named type, the instance table
  gained the ES2024 members (`growable` / `maxByteLength` / `grow`, and
  ArrayBuffer's `resizable` / `detached` / `resize`), and the surface
  registers as fully modeled so member misses are definite
  (`sab.length` — useSharedArrayBuffer6).
Batch BM (+9 TP, TP 2305 / MISS 429) took lib-set directives,
decorator signatures, and generator interface returns:
- TS2318 via parser markers: `@noLib: true` removes every required
  global type (parser509698); an explicit `@lib:` list without a
  full-year ES2015+ lib / `es2015.iterable` lacks `IterableIterator`
  for generators (generatorReturnTypeFallback.2, types.forAwait); one
  without `esnext` lacks `Disposable` for `using` declarations
  (usingDeclarations.9 / awaitUsingDeclarations.9 — the block-scoped
  `using` lowering records the marker too).
- TS1238 (`check_class_decorator_signatures`): a CLASS used as a class
  decorator is not callable (constructableDecoratorOnClass01); a
  decorator or factory result whose REQUIRED arity exceeds the runtime
  invocation (1 arg legacy / 2 standard, `<experimental-decorators>`
  marker) can never resolve (decoratorOnClass8, esDecorators-arguments).
  Zero-parameter decorators also error in tsc but are deliberately
  skipped. The parser now captures class decorators BEFORE the body
  parse — member decorators share `pending_decorators` and previously
  either leaked onto the next declaration or (after the first fix)
  masqueraded as class decorators (decoratorOnClassAccessor1 FP'd, and
  the base-less IIFE route plus `parse_class_stub` never attached them
  at all).
- TS2741 (`check_generator_interface_returns`): a generator whose
  declared return type is an interface extending
  Iterator/IterableIterator/Generator with extra REQUIRED members can
  never satisfy it (generatorTypeCheck7); optional extras abstain.
Batch BN (+6 TP, TP 2311 / MISS 423) took index keys and lib-era
signatures:
- TS7053: a string-literal key indexing a fully-literal-keyed object
  shape that provably lacks it, gated on the module's `noImplicitAny`
  (threaded through a new `Resolver.no_implicit_any` flag). Numeric
  keys fold (`0b11010:` provides `26`), and since OUR lexer folds
  OVERFLOWING binary/octal literals through a 32-bit wrap while tsc
  folds to `Infinity`/exponent form, fold-shaped queries abstain when
  any >9-digit folded key exists — `"0b11010"` contains `b` (never a
  fold) and stays decidable (binaryIntegerLiteral/ES6,
  octalIntegerLiteral/ES6).
- TS2464: `Symbol.keyFor` is a FUNCTION on SymbolConstructor, never a
  computed property key (symbolProperty59; `Symbol.for` lexes as a
  keyword and can't reach the match arm).
- TS2554: `Date.UTC(year)` requires the month argument before es2015 —
  fires only under the `<lib-lacks-iterable>` (pre-ES2015 lib) marker
  (es5DateAPIs).
Deferred: genericRestArity/Strict need tuple-arity inference from the
handler parameter (`call<TS extends unknown[]>(handler: (...args: TS)
=> void, ...args: TS)` — expected count = 1 + handler params), which
requires threading callee type-params into the arity checker.
Batch BO (+12 TP, TP 2323 / MISS 411) continued the small clusters:
- TS2491: the left side of `for...in` is never a destructuring pattern,
  declaration or assignment form (for-inStatementsDestructuring/2/3/4,
  parserForInStatement8 — always-error, `record_unfiltered`).
- TS2854: a TOP-LEVEL `await using` requires target >= es2017 — new
  `<top-level-await-using>` and `<target-below-es2017>` parser markers
  (multi-target conformance directives list pre-es2017 variants —
  awaitUsingDeclarations.1; .2/.3 parse through other shapes and stay
  misses).
- TS2550: `Object.values` / `Object.entries` need the es2017 lib
  surface, `Atomics.waitAsync` needs es2024 — `<lib-lacks-es2017>` /
  `<lib-lacks-es2024>` markers (explicit `@lib:` lacking the year, or
  no `@lib:` with an explicit sub-es2017 `@target:`), threaded through
  new `Resolver.lib_lacks_es2017/es2024` flags to the MethodCall carve
  (useObjectValuesAndEntries2/3, es2024SharedMemory).
- TS2503: an entity-reference import alias (`import X = A.B`) whose
  ROOT is provably undeclared — `<import-eq-root>` marker, resolved
  with the same contract as `<export-eq>` (parserImportDeclaration1,
  scannerImportDeclaration1).
- TS1003-adjacent: a primitive-type keyword can never be a qualified
  type-name segment (`var v: x.void` — parservoidInQualifiedName2).
Batch BP (+6 TP, TP 2329 / MISS 405) took TS2322 subclusters and
primitive spreads:
- `SharedArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBuffer` are nominally distinct lib
  types: `var foo: ArrayBuffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(...)` flags when
  neither name has a user declaration
  (assignSharedArrayBufferToArrayBuffer).
- `new Array<T>(n)` keeps the explicit element type (`Array(T)`), so a
  mismatched declared annotation flags (parserObjectCreation1).
- TS2698: an object-literal spread of a provably non-object primitive
  (string / numeric / template-literal-typed operand) — named /
  generic / union operands abstain (spreadNonObject1,
  spreadTypeVariable as a bonus flip).
- A provably NUMERIC computed key in an object literal checks its
  value against the target interface's number index signature
  (`var o: I = { [+"foo"]: "" }` where `[s: number]: boolean` —
  computedPropertyNamesContextualType10_ES5/ES6).
Batch BQ (+6 TP, TP 2335 / MISS 399) took the TS7057 generator cluster
and the deferred genericRestArity tuple arity:
- TS7057: in a generator lacking a return-type annotation (under
  noImplicitAny), a `yield` whose RESULT is consumed with no contextual
  type — three syntactically decidable shapes: unannotated Ident
  binding (`const value = yield`), a generic call argument whose
  matching parameter is a bare type param with no explicit type args
  (`f(yield)`), and `yield yield`. Unused results, annotated bindings,
  destructuring targets, and `f<string>(yield)` abstain
  (generatorImplicitAny, generatorTypeCheck50,
  generatorReturnTypeInference + NonStrict).
- TS2554 generic-rest-tuple arity: `call<TS extends unknown[]>(handler:
  (...args: TS) => void, ...args: TS)` needs exactly 1 + handler-param
  count arguments. The parser substitutes the tuple param with its
  bound, so the carve keys on the substituted single-type-param shape
  (`(...args: unknown[]/any[]) => R` + same-bound rest) with a
  syntactic all-required arrow handler (genericRestArity,
  genericRestArityStrict). A non-generic `unknown[]`-rest signature
  abstains.
Documented dead ends from this round: YieldExpression10_es6 (an
object-literal method's name in the backstop is indistinguishable from
a legal self-referential named function expression property);
symbolProperty3/59 (need the `Symbol` VALUE modeled as
`SymbolConstructor`); computedPropertyNames9 (needs overload+generic
call inference to pick `boolean`); the TS2403 identity cluster
(spreadUnion2 / typeOfThisGeneral etc. need inferred-initializer
identity; unionTypeEquivalence needs non-reducing union identity over
subtype-related classes).
Remaining TS7-only clusters (documented, unattempted): nested
class-expression computed keys (the parser lowers class expressions to
IIFEs, erasing the member structure), TS2339 Corsa behavior changes. (Final TS6 state for reference: TP 2669 /
FP 0 / TN 1414 / MISS 414 — the TS7 renumbering reflects dropped es5
variants and Corsa behavior changes, not checker regressions; the
582 misses include ~170 new TS7-only opportunities.)

The switch surfaced and fixed four latent checker bugs that es5-variant
errors had masked (batch BD): lib-global redeclarations are never
TS2454-unassigned; parameter-property assigns follow a `super()` buried
in the using-lowering's try/finally; spreads provide properties under
getters (`@@get:` names); an EXPLICIT `: any` parameter annotation is
never TS7006 (tracked via the parser's `written_any_params` set —
`TsParam.type_` alone cannot distinguish it).

PFLEGAL budget is 3: parser768531 (fuzz), decoratorOnClass3 and
defaultExportWithOverloads01 (both TS7-accepted forms our parser
rejects — parser follow-ups).

State: whole-corpus **TP 2669 / FP 0 / PFLEGAL 1 / TN 1414** against the
TypeScript conformance baselines (`.errors.txt` = ground truth). Standing CI
gate: `scripts/checker_conformance_oracle.sh --max-fp 0
--max-legal-parsefail 1`. Session arc TP 1761 -> 2631 across PRs #191-#200.
2473 unit tests. Parse failures with an error baseline count as TP ("via
parse rejection", 397); the one budgeted legal parse failure is
parser768531 (regex/division ambiguity needs parser-fed lexer context).

### Design constraints / known dead ends (re-attempt only with design work)

- The parser ERASES constrained type params to their bounds
  (`TS extends unknown[]` -> `Array(Unknown)`) in signature positions,
  making generic and non-generic spellings indistinguishable at check time
  (genericRestArity's variadic-handler shape). Un-erasing would also unlock
  constraint-carrying inference (wrappedAndRecursiveConstraints4).
- `moon check --deny-warn` fails on ~226 PRE-EXISTING deprecated-API
  warnings from toolchain drift; `moon test --target native` is the gate.
- The `do-while` checker arm deliberately leaks body rebinds past the loop;
  back-edge widening is `while`-only for that reason.
- `block_has_value_return` counts `return undefined` as a value return —
  correct for its arrow-void consumer; generator-TReturn checks use the
  separate `generator_body_returns_value`.
- The permissive filter suppresses bare arity messages unless
  `arity_reliable` / `record_unfiltered`; new diagnostics should reuse the
  "expected `X` but got `Y`" family (reliability-classified) where possible.
- Top-level `a = b;` parses as `Expr(AssignExpr(...))`, NOT stmt-level
  `Assign` — assignment rules must be wired into BOTH arms.

### Next tasks (in order)

1. [x] symbolProperty9/10/12 — DONE (batch BC): well-known-symbol
   computed keys (`[Symbol.X]`) now parse as stable `@@X` member names in
   classes AND interfaces (types were already retained; only the name was
   erased), shorthand type members (`{ x; y }`) parse as `any`-typed named
   members instead of collapsing the annotation, and a dedicated
   `symbol_member_shape_blocks` rule compares `@@`-member OBJECT shapes
   (annotation-vs-annotation, so `any`-valued keys stay REQUIRED — the
   general member compare tolerates missing `any` fields as an
   unmodeled-inference guard and can't decide these). symbolProperty46
   (accessor: setter param inferred from paired getter return, then
   symbol-keyed INDEX-assignment lookup) remains — needs accessor pairing
   machinery.
2. [x] Object member hiding — DONE (batch BC): (a) a source member
   hiding an `Object.prototype` member with an incompatible signature
   (checked via the object_prototype_member table) blocks assignment to
   the lib `Object`; (b) bare `Object` never satisfies a callable /
   constructable target. Module-declared `Object` shadows abstain
   (pinned). All three fixtures match tsc's per-line counts.
3. [x] generatorTypeCheck31 — DONE (batch BC): an unannotated
   `function*` expression now infers its return as
   `Generator<any, any, any>` (calling a generator produces the
   generator OBJECT, not its return value), and a new rule (1b) flags a
   `Generator` / `IterableIterator` / `AsyncGenerator` source against a
   function-typed target (no call signatures). Abstains when the fixture
   declares its own `Generator` interface. Pinned legal: `.next()` on
   the synthesized return, generator IIFEs into `Iterable` slots and
   `for..of` heads. TP 2642 -> 2643, FP 0.
4. [x] mapped types with `as` clauses — DONE (batch BC), three slices:
   (a) `resolver_eval_mapped_remap` concretely evaluates a remapped
   mapped type whose source enumerates to literal keys (`keyof M` over
   an interface): per key, the remap conditional decides via
   `extends_decision`, `T[K]` resolves through `lookup_field` (NOT
   `unwrap` — `simplify_indexed_access` degrades a `Named`-based access
   to `any`, which would make every filter trivially true), `never`
   filters, literals rewrite. Wired into `unwrap`'s mapped arm; bails
   for alias-named sources (recursion guard —
   mappedTypeAsClauseRecursiveNoCrash1 stays crash-free). Unlocks
   mappedTypeAsClauses (`KeysExtendedBy<M, number>` -> `"b"`).
   (b) Rule (1c): bare `val: T` into a remapped mapped type over
   `keyof T` — pure filters (`cond ? P : never`, no `-?`) are legal,
   key RENAMES flag even under `+?`, `-?` flags always
   (mappedTypeAsClauseRelationships, all 4 sites).
   (c) Rule (1d): reading `obj[key]` through a RENAMING remap with a
   non-materializable source (type param, possibly bound-erased to
   `string`/template) can't be correlated to a checkable target
   (mappedTypeConstraints2, 4 of 5 sites; the 5th has an `any`-typed
   expected slot and abstains). Filter remaps abstain (f5/f7/validate).
   TP 2643 -> 2646, FP 0.
5. [x] Lib surface models — DONE (batch BC): the `Error` / `Date`
   prototype tables already existed in `lookup_field_core`; the gap was
   that both member-miss flag sites suppress unresolved `Named`
   receivers. Added `lib_member_surface_complete` (bare `Error` / `Date`
   only, abstaining when a module-declared interface/class merges or
   shadows) and carves at the PropAccess and MethodCall miss sites, plus
   `cause` in the Error table (lib.es2022). Unlocks
   narrowFromAnyWithInstanceof (TS2551 typo members via
   `instanceof`-narrowed `any`) and
   propertyAccessOnTypeParameterWithConstraints4. Note: NO current miss
   depends on primitive METHOD-CALL existence (checked the corpus), so
   the String/Number method-call half was dropped — the tables stay
   incomplete (deprecated HTML methods like `"x".anchor()` are legal
   tsc) and flagging there would be FP-prone for zero recall.
   TP 2646 -> 2648, FP 0.
6. [x] TS2411 computed-property cluster — DONE (batch BC):
   (a) parser: constant computed class keys fold to their literal name
   (`["get1"]` -> get1, `[""]` -> "", `[1 << 6]` -> 64 via a small
   const-int evaluator) instead of `<computed>`; TS18006 exempts the
   computed `["constructor"]` form via `computed_field_keys` (tsc-legal).
   (b) checker: `check_index_props` gained a `symbol` index-signature
   arm constraining `@@X` members (symbolProperty17/32);
   `violates_index_value` gained a bivariant Func-vs-Func arm and a
   Named-class arm that flags only a MISSING required value member
   (`any`-typed members count as required; `?`-optional ones don't —
   `is_structurally_assignable_named` can't disprove, it tolerates
   missing `any` members by design). (c) the class TS2411 walk now
   models accessors (getter return inferred from the body, setter param
   type), infers unannotated method returns, and walks base chains both
   ways: inherited sigs constrain own members (43/44), own sigs
   constrain inherited members (45, symbolProperty32); inherited
   members are NOT re-checked against inherited sigs (no duplicates).
   Unlocks computedPropertyNames36/38/39/40/42/43/44/45_ES6 +
   symbolProperty17/32. TP 2648 -> 2658, FP 0.
7. [~] Edge buckets — `using` declarations DONE (batch BC): TS1492
   ('using' declarations may not have binding patterns) recorded as
   grammar misuses at three parse sites — parse_var_like (labelled
   `using_kw` param), the block-level using lowering (later declarators
   of a multi-declarator `using` land inside the init COMMA CHAIN as
   `AssignPattern` operands — scanned recursively), and the for-of head.
   TS2850/2851 (initializer must be disposable) decided only for the
   provable slice: an UNANNOTATED object-literal initializer whose keys
   are all plain (no `@@`-symbol / computed / spread entries), which
   definitely lacks `[Symbol.dispose]()`. Annotated declarations
   (`using d: T = {...}`) abstain — tsc checks the literal against `T`
   instead. Unlocks usingDeclarations.5/.7/.14,
   awaitUsingDeclarations.5/.7/.12, and both InForOf.3 files.
   TP 2658 -> 2666, FP 0.
   Also DONE from the TS1005 bucket: invalid radix digits — the lexer
   counts a binary / octal literal running into an out-of-radix decimal
   digit (`0b1102110`, `0o13334823`) and the parser surfaces one grammar
   misuse per literal (binaryIntegerLiteralError,
   octalIntegerLiteralError, invalidBinaryIntegerLiteralAndOctal-
   IntegerLiteral). TP 2666 -> 2669, FP 0.
   Remaining (documented, not attempted): the rest of the TS1005
   parser-recovery baselines (heterogeneous, require reproducing tsc's
   error-recovery token stream — e.g. `var x = /fo(o/;` regex re-scan),
   the IteratorObject `using` fixtures (need lib-level
   `Iterator.prototype[Symbol.dispose]` type modeling), and NOBASE
   variant-baseline files (oracle artifacts, not checker gaps).

## Checker conformance triage (MISS 176 -> a declared scope)

Full analysis and the measurements behind it: `docs/checker-triage.md`.

`MISS 176` is not a backlog. It sums work worth doing now with files
nobody should ever fix, so it can rank nothing and can never reach zero.
That is the defect that retired `docs/checker-priority.md`.

All 176 classified by the MACHINERY a rule would need (not by error code
— a code is not a difficulty class):

| family | files | | family | files |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| assignability-core | 48 | | strict-null / narrowing | 8 |
| symbol + computed key | 16 | | `this` typing | 7 |
| other (singletons) | 16 | | decorator signature | 7 |
| legacy / broken syntax | 15 | | locally accepted | 6 |
| mapped / conditional / template | 13 | | resource mgmt (`using`) | 6 |
| generic inference | 11 | | overload resolution | 2 |
| iterator protocol | 11 | | implicit-any / strict | 10 |

The biggest bucket ranks no work: all 48 `assignability-core` files open
to ~10 unrelated causes (variadic tuples, intersections, contextual
typing, `globalThis`, index-signature subtyping, spread types).

Feature frequency, measured over 3,000 real `.d.ts` + 2,697 real `.ts`:
conditional type **345**, `unique symbol` 183, mapped 143, `this` return
115, index signature 102, `[Symbol.x]` key 72, template-literal 57/151,
variadic tuple 20, **`using` 0**, **decorator 1**.

CAPABILITY PROBE (the table that reorders everything — the classification
says what a file NEEDS, not what we HAVE, and guessing at that was wrong
twice). Common shape of each family, probed against `tscheck --strict`
inside a function body:

- CAUGHT: basic assignability, argument count, missing property, mapped
  type via generic alias, `keyof`, strictNullChecks, `this` return type,
  index signature, variadic tuple, generic function inference.
- BLIND: conditional-via-generic-alias, the whole utility-type table,
  template-literal with a placeholder, computed `unique symbol` key,
  overload resolution.

### Tier 1 — SUPPORT NOW

- [~] **Conditional through a generic alias + the utility-type table.**
  PARTLY DONE (batch DI). `Resolver::unwrap` now has a `Conditional`
  arm — it was the only computed-type form of six without one — so
  `type E<T> = T extends string ? … ; E<string>` reduces, and the
  resolver consults `standard_utility_types()`, which had been
  reachable ONLY through `module_alias_resolver`, a `pub fn` with no
  caller outside its own file and its tests. Live now in both
  directions: `Exclude`, `Extract`, `NonNullable`.
  DONE too (batch DJ): the `infer`-binding half. `simplify_type`
  decides through the three-valued `extends_decision`, which cannot
  bind an `infer`, so `ReturnType` / `Parameters` / `Awaited` still
  abstained even with the `Conditional` arm in place.
  `reduce_conditional` (assignability.mbt) is the reducer that CAN —
  it runs `match_infer_pattern` and substitutes the captures — and it
  was reachable from `is_assignable_to` and from three return-type
  sites, but not from alias resolution. It is now tried from the
  `Conditional` arm, and ONLY when the extends type carries a marker:
  its non-infer path is `is_assignable_to`, which is two-valued, so as
  a general fallback it would take the FALSE branch on an undecidable
  `extends` and answer confidently exactly where `extends_decision`
  correctly says "don't know". `ReturnType`, `Parameters`, `Awaited`
  now decide in both directions; **TP 2558 -> 2559, MISS 176 -> 175,
  FP 0**. The extends side is deliberately NOT resolved through the
  resolver when a marker is present — that would rewrite the shape the
  pattern exists to align with.
  DONE too (batch DK): `InstanceType` and `ConstructorParameters`.
  The obvious suspect was `typeof C` — `unwrap`'s `TypeOf` arm reads
  `globals` and a class lives in `classes`, so `typeof C` really does
  arrive unresolved — and that was NOT the cause.
  `InstanceType<new () => C>`, with no `typeof` anywhere, was equally
  silent, which is what found the real defect: `contains_infer_marker`
  descended into `Func` and had NO `Constructor` arm, so it answered
  "no markers here" and the infer path never ran.
  `match_infer_pattern` and `substitute_inferred_type` both already
  handled `Constructor` — two of the trio right, the GATE wrong. Both
  fixes are needed (`class_construct_signature` for the `typeof`
  spelling), and the inline case is what proves which one mattered.
  The construct signature is supplied for the conditional DECISION
  only: a class's constructor side also carries its statics, which the
  checker states it does not model, so resolving `typeof C` everywhere
  would turn every static access through such a binding into a missing
  property. A derived class with no constructor of its own abstains —
  it inherits the base's.
  Buys 0 corpus files again; the capability is the point.
  Two things measured rather than assumed, both worth keeping:
  the whole change bought **ZERO corpus files** (predicted — take it
  for the capability), and wiring the FULL table was wrong: the
  property-shape entries (`Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`,
  `Record`, `Omit`) already have dedicated `lookup_field` arms and
  resolving them here moved the shape out from under those arms,
  failing three tests. The fallback is gated on the body being a
  `Conditional` — a shape test, not a name list, because a second copy
  of those names is the defect the batch exists to remove.
  And the conformance gate earned itself again: `ThisType<T>` is
  `interface ThisType<T> {}` in `lib.es5.d.ts`, an EMPTY marker, while
  the table encodes it as the identity for the contextual-`this`
  question. Taking that answer structurally made
  `PropDesc<U> & ThisType<T>` demand every member of `T` — one FP on
  `thisTypeInObjectLiterals2`, now resolved to `{}` ahead of the
  generic arm with the shared table left alone.
- [ ] (original entry, for reference)
  The single highest-value item. `(string extends string ? number :
  boolean)` inline is CAUGHT and `type E = string extends …` is CAUGHT,
  but `type E<T> = T extends string ? … ; E<string>` is BLIND — while
  generic alias instantiation itself works for object / array / union /
  passthrough / interface bodies, and `substitute_params`
  (`generics.mbt:63`) and `substitute_named` (`simplify.mbt:57`) both
  already have a `Conditional` arm. So this is a WIRING or
  reduction-order gap, one investigation rather than one implementation.
  It matters far beyond its 13 corpus files: every standard utility type
  is a generic alias over a conditional body, so `ReturnType`,
  `Exclude`, `NonNullable`, `Parameters` and `Awaited` are all inert in
  the body-checking path — a `.d.ts` using them type-checks by
  ABSTAINING, which is a silent hole in the bridge's primary input.
  Check first whether these blind rows are ONE abstention path: the
  control `Bogus<number>` (an unresolved generic name) is also silent.
- [x] **Computed `unique symbol` keys — REFRAMED, and the label was
  mine.** Opening all 16 files shows **11 distinct error codes**, so this
  was never one feature: the same "a NAME is not a feature cluster"
  mistake CLAUDE.md already records for the 21 `Symbol`-ish files. What
  the 16 actually are:
  - REJECTED already, with evidence: TS2466 x2 (batch CL measured 6 FPs
    for 2 TPs on object-literal computed keys, and
    `computedPropertyNames28` vs `30` is a distinction ONE file draws),
    and TS2464 `symbolProperty3` (`var s = Symbol` infers `Any`).
  - BLOCKED on overload resolution: TS2464 `computedPropertyNames9_*` x2
    (`[f(true)]` needs the right overload picked to see the key is
    `boolean`).
  - BLOCKED on lib interface merging: TS2411 x2
    (`objectType*HidingObjectIndexer`) augment the global `Object` and
    the error comes from the LIB's members conflicting with the user's
    index signature, under `skipDefaultLibCheck: false`.
  - BLOCKED on block-scope resolution: TS18033 x2 (`let Infinity = {}`
    shadowing the global inside a block, then `enum En { X = Infinity }`).
  - The rest (TS1166 x2, TS2322, TS2339, TS2353, TS2416, TS2403) are one
    unrelated thing each.
  DONE (batch DL) is the one genuinely cheap file, and it is not a symbol
  rule at all: TS2411 / TS2413 across MERGED interface declarations. The
  rule was complete and correct and read `module_.interfaces`, the
  per-DECLARATION list, so `interface A { [x: number]: string }` beside
  `interface A { [y: string]: {length: string} }` was silent while the
  identical members in ONE body were reported. **TP 2559 -> 2560, MISS
  175 -> 174.** Worth more than its one file: `interface Config {
  [k: string]: string; port: number }` is a mistake people actually make,
  and index signatures appear in 102 of 3,000 real `.d.ts` files.
- [x] **Overload resolution — DONE (batch DM), as TS2769.** The finding
  is bigger than the rule: an overloaded call had its arguments checked
  by NOTHING AT ALL. `g(true)` against `g(a: string)` / `g(a: number)`
  was silent, as were wrong arity and zero arguments, while the
  identical call to a single-signature `h(a: string)` was reported.
  Most of the standard library is overloaded, so the hole is wide on
  real input.
  Why it existed is worth keeping: overload sets ingest as a `Union` of
  call signatures, and `check_union_callee_arity` is DELIBERATELY not
  applied to them — its rule is that EVERY member must accept, right
  for a union-typed value and wrong for an overload set where one match
  is enough. That exclusion is correct and its comment says so; what
  was missing is that nothing took over.
  `check_overload_set_no_match` reports only when EVERY member is
  PROVEN unable to accept (arity, or a definite-primitive argument
  against a definite-primitive parameter it is not assignable to).
  That makes it sound for a union-typed VALUE too — if no constituent
  can accept, the call is wrong under either reading — so it is not
  gated on `resolver.signatures` and the two rules need not be told
  apart. Abstention is per-member with an early return: one member that
  merely MIGHT accept silences the call, which is what keeps a generic
  overload, an object-typed parameter, a rest parameter, a spread
  argument and an unreadable member silent.
  Cost one FALSE POSITIVE first, and the hazard was already written
  down: `check_union_callee_arity`'s comment records that "two callables
  can have identical widened parameter types while differing in whether
  that parameter was written with `?`", and a `declare function`
  overload arrives with its optionality widened into the type
  (`a?: string` becomes `string | undefined`) and an empty
  `optional_params` — so `t()` against `t(a?: string)` was reported. A
  parameter that ACCEPTS undefined is now treated as omittable, which
  over-counts optionals and therefore only ever weakens the proof
  (batch CU's decorator arity took the same trade).
  0 corpus files (the one TS2769 miss is a generic-inference case), but
  it CLOSES a known-gap fixture: `fixtures/mtsc/known-gaps/overload-resolution.ts`
  moves from "records what we miss" to a regression pin.
  KNOWN LIMIT, silence not a finding: an overload set declared as real
  `function` declarations WITH an implementation does not reach this
  check on the strict path — the `resolver.signatures` branch claims the
  callee first. It works on the permissive path (which is what the
  fixture exercises). Filed rather than fixed: the fix means touching
  the single-signature argument checker.

### Tier 2 — SUPPORT (cheap, mechanical, ~25 files)

- [x] **Batch DN: TS2371 + TS2394, +3 files at FP 0** (TP 2560 -> 2563,
  in-scope MISS 157 -> 154) — `parserParameterList16`/`17` and
  `parserClassDeclaration12`, the three files Tier 4 had mis-filed under
  legacy/broken-syntax.
  - TS2371 is the applied-in-some-places family in its strongest form:
    the rule was not similar to an existing one, it WAS one. It lived as
    a LOCAL function at the two bodiless exits of `parse_function_decl`,
    and inline through a different channel for interface members, and the
    CLASS path had nothing — `class C { foo(a = 4); foo(a, b) {} }` parsed
    clean. Hoisted to one `Parser::record_bodiless_param_initializers`.
    The rule is about the BODY and nothing else, so the test is
    `has_body_block` rather than the modifiers; every bodiless position
    was probed (overload signature, `abstract`, `declare class`,
    `interface`, object type, function TYPE, `declare function`) and all
    report. The legal neighbours are the two the message names plus an
    ARROW, whose body follows the `=>` — which is what a class field
    holding `(a = 1) => a` is.
  - TS2394's arity half is ONE-directional and the message text does not
    say which direction, so the table was probed cell by cell: an
    implementation requiring MORE than a signature can supply is the
    error, a SHORTER implementation is legal. Four of the eight silent
    test cases are what a rule written from the message alone would
    flag. A TYPE mismatch raises the same code and is abstained on.
- [ ] Remaining grammar / declaration rules: TS2386, TS2448, TS1308,
  TS2842, TS2708, TS1166, TS2300.
- [x] **Batch DO: TS7009 and `&&=`, +4 files at FP 0** (TP 2563 -> 2565,
  in-scope MISS 153 -> 150 after two accidental TPs moved to Tier 4).
  Three findings, and two of them are about code that was already there.
  - **TS7009** is TS2350's rule with its exclusion removed, and the FLAG
    decides which of the two applies — probed both ways. With
    `noImplicitAny` off, `new f()` errors iff `f`'s return is not `void`
    (TS2350); with it on there is no exemption at all, and tsc reports
    even `function Point(x) { this.x = x }; new Point(1)`. The old
    `resolver.signatures` early return excluded every top-level function
    DECLARATION by name, which was REDUNDANT for TS2350 (an old-style
    constructor's return is `void`, which the return-type predicate
    already abstains on) and was the only thing blocking TS7009. It also
    lost the commoner spelling with the flag off — a declared function
    with a non-void return annotation, excluded before any type was
    consulted.
    TS7009 needs POSITIVE evidence where TS2350 could lean on abstention,
    and the unit suite proved it: the unrestricted version was +2 corpus
    files and **5 false positives** (`localTypes2/3/5`,
    `classExpression4`, `privateNameMethodAsync`), because the parser
    lowers a class declared INSIDE a function to a function — so
    `function outer() { class A { x = 1 } return new A() }` arrives as a
    `Func` and is a legal `new`. Gated to a top-level function
    declaration or a WRITTEN call-signature object type: +1 at FP 0. The
    file it gave up was flagged for the unsound reason.
  - **`a &&= b`** is `a && (a = b)`, so when `a` is falsy the result is
    `a` and `b` never runs. `infer_expr`'s compound-assign arm returned
    the RIGHT-HAND SIDE for all fifteen operators — right for the twelve
    arithmetic and bitwise ones, wrong for this one — which is why
    `(results &&= []).push(100)` was silent while tsc reports TS2532.
    `||=` and `??=` do NOT widen: the operator has already removed the
    nullish part of the target, so unioning it back in would report the
    legal spellings (probed: `logicalAssignment6/7/8` error on their
    `&&=` function and nothing else). Needed a second change, and the
    abstention it relaxes states its own reason: the strictNullChecks
    member-access checks are gated to a bare `Var` receiver because
    those are the bindings the narrowing engine rewrites precisely. A
    `&&=` receiver qualifies for the OPPOSITE reason — there is no
    narrowing to get wrong, its type is computed from the operator's
    semantics, and the target is inferred through the same `env`.
    `nullish_checkable_receiver` is the one predicate both sites now ask.
  - **A pre-existing false positive**, found by probing a legal
    neighbour for the rule above rather than by any gate: `+=`'s
    string-concatenation exemption tested for `String_` EXACTLY, so
    `let t = ""` — whose type here is the literal `""`, since tsc widens
    it and we do not — demanded a numeric target and reported ordinary
    string building. Asking assignability widens the EXEMPTION, so it can
    only lose a finding. Removing it cost **two TPs**, and that is the
    batch's own lesson repeated from CS with the sign flipped:
    `parserRealSource1`/`2` were flagged for `result += "\\t"` and
    nothing else, while their real TS7 error is the TS6053 that already
    puts `parserRealSource3` in Tier 4. They are declared there now, and
    `--max-miss` — added one batch earlier — is what surfaced them.
- [x] **Batch DP: every checker class rule now sees a class declared
  inside a function** (+1 file, TP 2565 -> 2566, in-scope MISS 150 ->
  149, FP 0). The count is not the point: the rules were silent at every
  depth but zero.
  - `TsModule.classes` is filled by the module-level statement
    dispatcher, the only thing that took the parser's
    `last_runtime_class_decl` stash, so a class one scope in was recorded
    nowhere a rule could read. Probed before and after: TS2420
    (implements), TS2415/TS2417 (extends compatibility) and TS2564
    (definite assignment) all fired at top level and at no other depth,
    while batch DN's TS2394 fired in both because it lives in the parser.
    Now covered in a function body, a block, an `if` branch and an arrow
    body.
  - The parser collects them into `TsModule.local_classes` and the
    checker merges the two at ONE entry point, which is what makes all
    ~58 `module_.classes` loops see them without touching any of them.
    `check_module` is deliberately excluded: its first act is a
    duplicate-declaration scan across every top-level kind.
  - **The merge cost four false positives before it was right, and every
    one is the same mistake**: `module_.classes` does not mean "the
    classes", it means "the classes with no enclosing scope", and three
    rules depend on the second reading.
    * `localTypes2`/`3` — the resolver's NAME table must not learn a
      block-scoped name. A nested `class C` beside `let C = f(10)` made
      `new C(20)` resolve to the class and fail its constructor arity.
      `Resolver::ingest_module` skips `is_local`.
    * `classConstructorAccessibility4` — `new A()` inside a class nested
      in A's own method is legal. A's method body is already scanned with
      `enclosing = "A"`; scanning the nested class's body as if it were
      top level reported the same expression again.
    * `privateNameComputedPropertyName3` — `check_private_member_access`
      states its premise in its own doc comment ("nested class bodies are
      skipped — their accesses may legally reach an outer class's
      privates"), and the merge broke exactly that.
    So `TsClassDecl` carries `is_local`, the three position-dependent
    consumers test it, and the rest do not. Skipping a name already
    declared at top level (or repeated among the local classes) is what
    stops `function f() { class A {} } class A {}` reading as a duplicate.
  - Measured linear: a hand ladder of N classes-inside-functions is
    32/62/130/267 ms at 500/1000/2000/4000 (exponent 1.02), and the
    scaling gate's seven axes are unchanged.
  - Known remainder, deliberately not chased: a nested class whose BASE is
    also nested does not resolve its base chain, because the base is not
    in the resolver's name table either. That loses a finding rather than
    inventing one.
- [x] **Batch DQ: the same rules also see a class EXPRESSION** (+3 files,
  TP 2566 -> 2569, in-scope MISS 149 -> 146, FP 0). Probed first, which
  is what made the axis worth taking: TS2420 / TS2415 / TS2564 all fire
  on a class DECLARATION, on `declare class` AND on a namespace-scoped
  class, and on `const C = class …` not one of them did — while
  `const C = class {}` is how a mixin, a HOC and a decorated factory
  class are all written.
  - `parse_class_stub` records into `local_classes` from **both** of its
    exits, which is the whole finding: the native `NativeClassExpr` exit
    is taken only when there is an `extends` clause, and a base-less
    class expression falls through to the desugar below it. Recording at
    the first alone bought exactly the one rule that needs a base —
    TS2415 fired and the other two stayed silent — which is how the
    split was found rather than assumed.
  - An anonymous class expression gets a per-occurrence synthetic name.
    Per-occurrence and not one shared `<class expression>`, because the
    merge skips a repeated name and a file with several anonymous
    classes is the normal case; pinned by a test that asserts BOTH of
    two get checked.
  - One false positive, and it is the DP lesson on a fifth axis:
    TS2449 ("class used before its declaration") compares INDICES in
    `module_.classes`, which encode top-level source order — and a local
    class is APPENDED, so its index is not a position. Reading it as one
    made every top-level class whose base shares a name with a class
    expression look forward-referencing
    (`accessorsOverrideProperty8`: `const Base = classWithProperties(…,
    class Base {})` beside `class MyClass extends Base`). Exempting
    local classes on both sides costs the mirror MISS —
    `const D = class extends B {}; class B {}` IS TS2449 and stays
    quiet — which is the affordable half.
- [x] **Batch DR: the nullish operators, +3 files at FP 0** (TP 2569 ->
  2572, in-scope MISS 146 -> 143). Three rules, each with a boundary that
  had to be probed cell by cell because reasoning about it gives the
  wrong answer.
  - **TS2869** ("right operand of `??` is unreachable") is purely
    SYNTACTIC in tsc, which is the finding: `false ?? true`, `0 ?? 1`,
    `{} ?? y` and `(() => 1) ?? y` all report, while
    `const m = false; m ?? true` and `declare const s: string; s ?? "b"`
    are ACCEPTED — neither can be nullish either. A type-level version
    would have reported two shapes tsc allows. Sibling of the TS2872 /
    TS2873 literal-operand rules on `!` and `||`, and it reuses their
    literal classification. `null` / `undefined` are excluded (tsc gives
    them TS2871, a different code); `void 0` is a declared MISS — tsc
    reports TS2869 there but the right operand really IS reached, so
    following it would encode a compiler quirk as a rule.
  - **TS18048 / TS18049**: the right operand of `??` runs only when the
    left is nullish, so inside it the left BINDING is narrowed to its
    nullish part and a member access on it is always an error
    (`f ?? f.toFixed()`). It matches the right operand's SHAPE rather
    than walking it, and that is the soundness argument: an assignment
    anywhere inside the RHS makes the binding non-nullish again
    (`s ?? ((s = "x"), s.length)` is ACCEPTED, measured), and a walk that
    missed an assignment form would fail OPEN into a false positive.
    When the access IS the whole right operand nothing can hide in it.
  - **TS2790** ALREADY EXISTED for `delete o.b` and was blind to the two
    other spellings of the same property reference. `delete o?.b` arrives
    as `OptionalChain(PropAccess(…))` and the match saw the WRAPPER —
    the fourth time in this repo that a wrapper node's default arm has
    cost a silent miss, after `TypeArgs` and `PureCall` twice — and
    `delete o["b"]` had no arm at all. Inside an optional chain the
    receiver's nullish part is pruned, which is exactly what the `?.`
    guarantees.
- [ ] **REJECTED for now with the condition: TS7031 / TS7018** (a nullish
  literal where a type must be inferred, under `noImplicitAny` with
  `strictNullChecks` OFF — `var [a, b] = [undefined, null]` and
  `const o = { value: null }`). The rule is sound and the family is one
  rule with three codes (TS7005 for a plain `const v = null` too), but
  the blocker is mechanical and exact: **`var [a, b]: any = [undefined,
  null]` is ACCEPTED by tsc and the unannotated form is TS7031**, while
  `TsStmt::Let` / `Const` / `Var` carries a `TsType` in which an ABSENT
  annotation and an explicit `: any` are the same `Any`. The parser has
  that fact at parse time — `parse_param` records it in
  `written_any_params` via `had_annotation` — so the fix is a
  declaration-level equivalent of that channel plus a `strict_null_checks`
  field on the Parser (which has `no_implicit_any` and not this one).
  Two channels for two corpus files, only one of which
  (`{ value: null }` in a legacy migration) has real-world value.
- [x] **Batch DS: TS2386 / TS2394 / TS2565, +3 files at FP 0** (TP 2572 ->
  2575, in-scope MISS 143 -> 140). Three unrelated rules, and all three
  read WRONG from their message text alone.
  - **TS2386** ("overload signatures must all be optional or required")
    is purely about the `?`, so it needs no type and lives in the parser.
    It needed **four** sites — a runtime class body, an interface, an
    object type literal and `declare class` each have their own member
    parser — which is the applied-in-some-places family again, taken
    completely on the first pass rather than discovered later. In a
    runtime class the IMPLEMENTATION participates as REQUIRED: probing
    `m?(x); m?(s); m(v) { }` reports on BOTH signatures, so recording
    only the bodiless declarations would have accepted it. `declare
    class`'s member parser DISCARDED the `?` (`let _ =
    self.match_(Question)`), which is why that site was the one with
    nothing. Only METHOD signatures participate: two same-named
    PROPERTIES are a duplicate identifier (TS2300 / TS2717), a different
    error that already fires, so putting properties in would report one
    declaration twice. Accessors and `constructor` cannot carry `?` at
    all. Keyed by static-ness as well as name, since `static m` and `m`
    are two members and need not agree.
  - **TS2394's parameter half** is where the batch-DN blocker finally
    dissolved. `TsFunc.body` is not optional, so an overload SIGNATURE
    and an implementation are indistinguishable downstream — and
    `note_function_declaration` is called at every one of the four sites
    that pushes a function declaration, with exactly the `bodiless` fact,
    so a `<fn-impl:NAME>` marker makes "the last declaration is the
    implementation" a FACT instead of the guess the neighbouring
    `check_overload_void_return` had to make. The rule was added to that
    same function rather than beside it. Probed cell by cell, because the
    message ("not compatible with its implementation signature") does not
    say which direction: an incompatible parameter TYPE is the error
    (`f(x: "a"); f(x: number) { }`), an implementation with FEWER
    parameters is LEGAL (a shorter function is assignable to a longer
    one), and `any` accepts everything. Only a pair of
    definitely-concrete primitives incompatible in BOTH directions is
    judged; a type parameter, an object shape, a union or a missing
    annotation abstains.
  - **TS2565** ("property is used before being assigned") is expando
    flow: `function d() { }` then `d.e = 12`, and reading a property
    assigned only inside a conditional branch. One ordered pass per
    statement list tracking DEFINITE / POSSIBLE per `HOLDER.PROP`, and
    the `if` statement is the ONLY construct that produces `possible` —
    a write in anything this pass does not model counts as definite, so
    an unmodelled shape SILENCES the check instead of firing on it. That
    is what `switch (1) { default: d.q = 1 }` needs: the default arm
    always runs and tsc accepts the following read, so any
    reachability-aware formulation would have false-positived there. It
    costs the `while` case, which tsc DOES report, and that MISS is what
    buys FP 0.
    Three things had to be probed rather than reasoned. `d["q"] = 1` and
    `d.q = 1` are NOT the same rule: inside an `if` arm the bracket
    spelling makes the later `d.q` LEGAL and the dotted one does not, so
    the two spellings are collected separately and only the dotted one
    can be merely-possible. Passing the holder to a function does NOT
    assign the property (nor does `Object.assign`), so the report still
    stands there. And a read from ANOTHER scope is legal however the
    property was assigned — the corpus file says so in its own comment
    and `function later() { return d.q }` confirms it — so the read walk
    stops at a nested function body and at a nested block, while the
    WRITE walk descends into both (calling a write definite is the quiet
    direction).
    Two parser facts cost the first two drafts. `d.q = 1` at the top of a
    list is a `PropAssign` STATEMENT while the identical line inside a
    block is `Expr(PropAssignExpr(...))`, and reading only the first
    found NOTHING at all — the same two-spellings-one-rule shape as
    TS2386 above, in the AST instead of in the parsers. And a top-level
    `function d() { }` is parsed by the module loop into `module_.funcs`
    and is NOT pushed into `top_level_stmts`, so the outermost list has
    to be told about those holders by name and each such body scanned
    explicitly.
- [x] **Batch DT: TS7010 at the member signatures, TS7022 / TS2448 at
  both self-reference sites, +2 files at FP 0** (TP 2575 -> 2577,
  in-scope MISS 140 -> 138). Both rules are the applied-in-some-places
  family, and BOTH had a comment at the missing site stating an
  abstention whose stated reason turned out to be FALSE — which is the
  reusable finding: a recorded abstention is a lead, and its reason still
  has to be probed.
  - **TS7010** ("'X', which lacks return-type annotation, implicitly has
    an 'any' return type") existed for a bodiless `function` declaration
    and for `declare function` and for NOTHING else, so an interface
    method, an object-type method, a class overload signature, an
    `abstract` member and a `declare class` member were all silent. One
    recorder, four member parsers. The class site carried a comment
    declining it because "tsc does not flag an overload signature whose
    implementation carries the return annotation" — probed, `m();
    m(x: number); m(x?: number): void { }` reports on BOTH signatures,
    while `m(): void; m(x: number): void; m(x?: number) { }` (annotated
    signatures, unannotated implementation) is ACCEPTED. The exemption
    belongs to the BODY, not to the overload set, so the stated reason
    was the inverse of the truth. Accessors and bare properties are
    excluded because tsc gives them TS7033 and TS7008, two different
    rules. The test is on whether an annotation was WRITTEN, not on the
    resolved type: `foo(n: string): any` is accepted and the parsers
    default a missing annotation to `Void`/`Any`, so the two are
    indistinguishable afterwards.
  - **TS7022 / TS2448** (a binding whose own initializer evaluates a
    reference to it) existed for a `for…of` head whose iterable is a bare
    `Var` and was missing at the DECLARATION site, so `let x = x`,
    `const x = [x]` and `let x = typeof x` were all silent. The head
    rule's walk was two arms wide with a comment claiming that widening
    past them "would claim a cycle that is not one" for a name reached
    through a call or a property. Probed, the dividing line is not
    call-versus-property but whether the reference is EVALUATED before
    the binding initializes: `for (let v of [v])`, `[1, v]`, `g(v)` and
    `[...xs, v]` all report, while `o.v` does not (a property NAME is a
    `String` in this AST and can never be reached as a `Var`) and
    `[() => v]` does not (the body runs later). One shared walk now
    serves both sites. Two codes, one condition, each gated on the fact
    it needs: TS2448 applies to `let`/`const` whatever the annotation
    says (`let x: number = x` is still TS2448, the TDZ being about time),
    while TS7022 needs the annotation ABSENT and is all a `var` gets.
  - Threading `head_annotated` in from the parse site fixed a
    **pre-existing false positive** the head rule's own comment had
    promised not to have: it gated on `var_type is Any`, which cannot
    tell an absent annotation from an explicit `: any`, so
    `for (var v: any of v)` was reported. And the comment's claim that
    the spelling is "legal" is also wrong — tsc gives it TS2483 + TS2502,
    two codes this rule does not claim, so the old behaviour was the
    right file for the wrong reason and abstaining costs a MISS.
  - **Three pre-existing tests asserted the TS7010 gap by name** — the
    eighth, ninth and tenth in this repo found doing that. The
    TS2387/TS2388, TS2391 and class-expression tests all wrote
    `class C { foo(x: number); foo(x: any) {} }` and asserted 0, and
    `parse_module_or_empty` defaults `noImplicitAny` to TRUE, so every
    one of those sources is a file tsc rejects. Annotating the
    signatures makes each test measure the rule it is named for.
- [ ] **MOVED TO TIER 3 with evidence: TS7023 (3 files) and TS7053 (2).**
  The triage called the whole implicit-any family "cheap and
  mechanical"; opening the files says otherwise, and that is the
  label-for-objective substitution again. TS7023's three files
  (`for-of33` / `-34` / `-35`) need an inference CYCLE detector through
  a class method's un-annotated return type — the only cheap version
  keys on the exact corpus shape ("the iterated class's `next()` returns
  the loop variable"), which is fitting the corpus for three files
  nobody's real code resembles. TS7053's two need
  union-of-index-signature member resolution and assignment-target
  widening of `(options || {}).a`; both files also carry TS2339 /
  TS2322 for the same underlying reason, which is what says it is one
  Tier 3 capability rather than a grammar rule.
- [ ] **FILED: `for (let v of [() => v])` is a pre-existing false
  positive** — "cannot find name `v`" from the undefined-name walk, on a
  file tsc ACCEPTS. The for-of head binding is entered into `env` AFTER
  the iterable is inferred (correct for the TDZ), so an arrow body
  inside the iterable cannot see it, while the same arrow in the loop
  BODY resolves fine. Invisible to the conformance gate (no corpus file
  has the shape) and pre-existing, verified against the pre-batch
  binary. The fix has to bind the name for the undefined-name channel
  only, without giving `infer_expr` a type for it during the iterable's
  own inference.
- [x] **Batch DU: TS2729 for a field with NO initializer, +1 file at
  FP 0** (TP 2577 -> 2578, in-scope MISS 138 -> 137). Third batch in a
  row whose target was a recorded ABSTENTION, and the third whose stated
  reason was false — which makes "open the comment that declines the
  rule, then probe its reason" the highest-yield move left in this tier.
  `check_class_property_init_order` restricted its candidate set to
  init-bearing fields, saying a field declared without an initializer
  "has no initialization to be 'used before'". It has:
  `class C { b; d = this.b }` and `class C { b: number; d = this.b }`
  are both TS2729 in either declaration order, because a slot only
  written in the CONSTRUCTOR is still `undefined` while field
  initializers run — so such a field never enters the `inited` set and
  order does not matter for it.
  The real exemption is a MODIFIER, and probing one cell at a time gives
  exactly two: `!` and `?`. It is emphatically NOT "the declared type
  admits undefined" — `b: number | undefined`, `b: any`, `b: unknown`
  and `b: void` all report, and so does the whole thing under
  `strictNullChecks: false`, so a rule written from the type would have
  been wrong in four places. And since the parser wraps `x?: T` into
  exactly `T | undefined`, the `?` CANNOT be read off the type: it rides
  an `<optional-member:` sentinel through the class's duplicate-member
  channel, recorded before the wrap, the same shape as
  `<quoted-member:` (which exists because TS2564 needed a fact the type
  could not carry either).
  `scopeResolutionIdentifiers`, the false positive the old abstention
  was protecting against, is the `s!: Date; n = this.s;` form — so it
  was avoided for the wrong reason and is still avoided, for the right
  one.
  One declared MISS, stated at the site: `declare b: T` is TS2729 in
  tsc, and the parser folds `has_declare` into `has_definite_assertion`
  (correctly, for TS2564), so an ambient field reads as asserted here.
  That loses a finding and cannot invent one.
- [x] **Batch DV: TS7022's INDIRECT form through the iteration protocol,
  +3 files at FP 0** (TP 2578 -> 2581, in-scope MISS 137 -> 134). A
  `for (var v of new C)` head takes its element type from C's iteration
  protocol, so an un-annotated `next()` / `[Symbol.iterator]()` that
  RETURNS `v` is a genuine inference cycle.
  Batch DT declined exactly these three files one batch earlier, saying
  "the only cheap version would key on the exact corpus shape". That was
  too pessimistic, and the thing that settles it was in the corpus the
  whole time: **`for-of25` and `for-of26` are `for-of33` and `for-of34`
  with the returned name changed** from the loop variable `v` to an
  unrelated `var x: any`, and both are TS7-ACCEPTED. So the
  discriminator is the NAME — the actual semantic distinction, not a
  match on file contents — and the corpus supplies its own negative
  controls, twelve of them counting `for-of19`-`23`, `27`, `28`, `30`,
  `31` and `ES5For-ofTypeCheck10`. Fourth time in this series that a
  stated abstention's reason turned out weaker than claimed, and the
  first where the abstention was my own from the batch before.
  Implemented entirely in the PARSER, which is what keeps it small: the
  class body records the bare `Var` names its un-annotated protocol
  methods return, keyed by class name, and
  `record_for_head_binding_misuses` — where TS7022's DIRECT form already
  lives — joins against `new C`. The mention test is
  `collect_iterable_var_names`, the same walk the direct form uses,
  because "does this expression evaluate a reference to NAME" is the same
  question and a second walk would be the applied-in-some-places family
  in its purest form.
  Every gate was probed, and three of them are what keep it off legal
  code. Only the two PROTOCOL methods count — a `helper()` returning the
  loop variable is ACCEPTED, because nothing consults its return type.
  An annotated return breaks the cycle, so this needs
  `had_return_annotation` rather than `return_type is Any` (the AST
  cannot tell an absent annotation from an explicit `: any` — the same
  blocker recorded for TS7031 and TS2729). And a name the method itself
  BINDS is its own local: `next() { let v = { value: 1, done: false };
  return v }` beside `for (var v of new C)` is TS7-ACCEPTED, so firing
  there would be a false positive on legal code that no corpus file
  covers. The bound-name set is deliberately over-approximated (a
  nested block's `let`, a nested function's parameter), which loses
  findings rather than inventing them.
  Three declared MISSes, each stated at the site: a `let`/`const` head
  (the class body is outside the loop's block scope, so tsc gives
  TS2304 there and a different check already reports it), an
  annotation-typed iterable (`declare const c: C; for (var v of c)`,
  which needs the annotation resolved), and an IIFE inside the return
  (`return (() => v)()`, which tsc reports because the IIFE's return
  type feeds back).
  The other half of the indirect form — generic return-type inference
  from a callback (`let x = arr.map(v => x)`) — is NOT covered and is
  Tier 3: probing shows the reportable class needs the callee's
  signature and generic inference, since `let x = g(() => x)` with `g`
  declaring a return type is ACCEPTED while `arr.map` is not, and
  `let x = function () { return x }`, `[() => x]` and `{ m: () => x }`
  are all accepted too.
- [ ] **FILED: TS2393 for duplicate top-level function implementations.**
  Batch DS's `<fn-impl:NAME>` marker removes the blocker
  `check_function_var_duplicates`' comment used to name, and it is pushed
  once per implementation, so a COUNT is already available. What it does
  NOT do is distinguish two implementations from two SCOPES: the marker
  is restricted to the module / namespace body loop precisely because
  `grammar_misuses` is flat and scope-blind, so `function f() { }` at top
  level beside `function g() { function f() { } }` would otherwise read as
  two implementations of one name and two legal scopes. With that
  restriction in place the count is honest for the top level, and TS2393
  is a small step from here — it was left out of batch DS only because
  nothing in the corpus needed it. The class-member version already
  exists and needs no scope model, a class body being one.
- [x] strict-null / narrowing: 3 of 8 in batch DO (the `logicalAssignment`
  files). Five left.

### Tier 3 — DEFER (~93 files, real but expensive)

`assignability-core` (48), `generic-inference` (11), `iterator-protocol`
(11), `this-typing` (7), `other` (16). Every one is genuine TS behaviour
needing machinery we have not built: intersection reduction, contextual
typing, `globalThis` modelling, index-signature subtyping, the
async-iterator protocol. Do NOT take these for the MISS count — the
measured rate is 2-12 files per batch. Take an individual file only when
a real bridge input or `mtsc` target demands it, and record which one did.

`decorator-signature` (7) sits here on a CAVEAT rather than a
measurement: this corpus samples no Angular / NestJS / TypeORM. Promote
if a bridge target uses them.

### Tier 4 — WON'T SUPPORT (17 files, declared out of scope) — DONE

- [x] `scripts/checker_out_of_scope.txt`, one path per line with its kind
  and reason. The estimate was ~24 and the answer is **17**, because the
  estimate came from the family classifier and the 17 came from OPENING
  every file. Both corrections are the label-standing-in-for-the-objective
  substitution CLAUDE.md records five times, and the file itself is the
  only defence:
  - **legacy / broken syntax, 6 of 15 — not 12.** The classifier keyed on
    the DIRECTORY, and `parser/ecmascript5/` holds ordinary current
    TypeScript beside the error-recovery corpus. OUT: `x: break`,
    `x: public`, `interface I { [public a] }`,
    `import x = module("m")`, `///<reference>` path resolution (TS6053 is
    program construction, and the checker has no notion of a program), and
    the regex-versus-comment torture file. IN: `parserExportAssignment6`
    is `declare module "M" { export = A }`, an undefined-name check;
    `parserES5SymbolProperty4` is `[Symbol.isRegExp]`, a lib member
    lookup; `parserCastVersusArrowFunction1` and
    `parserConstructorAmbiguity3` have parse-ambiguity PURPOSES and
    ordinary DIAGNOSTICS (TS2403 on nine conflicting `var v`, TS2558
    type-argument arity), which is not the same thing. Plus the three
    already known not to be legacy (`parserParameterList16`/`17`,
    `parserClassDeclaration12` — the TS2371/TS2394 overload rules, Tier 2).
  - **`using` declarations, 5 of 6.** ZERO occurrences in 5,697 real
    files, the strongest out-of-scope case here; revisit if a real
    dependency adopts explicit resource management. But a file NAMED for
    `using` can carry an error `using` has nothing to do with:
    `usingDeclarationsWithObjectLiterals2` is TS7018 on `value: null`,
    which a plain `const` reproduces under the same two flags (probed), so
    it is Tier 2's implicit-any family and stays in scope.
  - **locally accepted, 6.** TS7 errors and local tsc 6.0.3 accepts, so
    there is no oracle to develop against and no way to write the
    legal-neighbour test this repo requires of every rule. The only
    out-of-scope reason here that is a HARNESS limit rather than a
    judgement about the language — revisit when the local compiler moves.
  - The one thing that keeps this from rotting into a suppression list:
    the oracle reports **STALE** entries — a listed path that is no longer
    a MISS, because a rule landed or the file left the corpus. Proven by
    adding a bogus path and seeing it named.

### The recommendation that is not a rule — DONE

- [x] **Two MISS numbers.** `MISS in scope 143` (the backlog, which can
  reach zero) beside `OUT OF SCOPE 19` (declared). `--scope-file /dev/null`
  reproduces the old single 174 — verified, not asserted.
  Nothing but the MISS branch consults the scope file, so a listed file can
  still be a TP, an FP or a PFLEGAL exactly as before: being out of scope
  withholds a rule, it does not excuse a wrong answer. The FP budget is
  untouched at 0.
- [x] `just verify-checker-soundness` gains `--max-miss`, which closes
  a direction NOTHING watched: a rule that stops firing moves a file from
  TP to MISS, and every other number in the report absorbs that silently.
  Lower the budget whenever a batch improves it, the way the FP budget only
  ever tightened.
